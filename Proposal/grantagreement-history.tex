\begin{enumerate}
\item Updated participant acronyms for consistency with the EU portal.

\item Resources for UPSud: reinstated PhD position that was planned in
  the budget but went missing in the proposal document: +36PM for UPSud.
\item Reinstated related task T6.5 ``Knowledge-based code infrastructure''.
  +33PM for WP6
\item Minor update to the involvement for Pons, Hivert, Lelièvre at
  UPSud for consistency with the submitted budget (-1PM each).
\item Minor update to the involvement for Gouarin at CNRS to make up
  for a higher salary than expected (-1PM); adapted accordingly WP2
  (-1PM).
\item Where relevant: updated PM information according to the above.

\item WP2: Added mention of our participation to the European
  E-Infrastructure concertation activities.

\item Updated resources to be committed: audit costs should be in the
  direct costs, not subcontracting.

\item Updated the risk table to address the reviewers comments.

\item As suggested by the project officer, reduction of the number of
  deliverables (typically by merging together intermediate
  check-points into the corresponding final deliverable):

    \begin{itemize}
    \item D2.10 Course material on using OpenDreamKit in data science;
    \item D2.12, D2.13 indexing service;
    \item D2.20 Demonstrator: Interactive lecture notes and marking
      systems based on OpenDreamKit.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Merged together D1.5 and D1.8 (Data Management Plan V2,V3)
  \item Merged D2.2, D2.7, D2.14, D2.19, D2.25, and D2.26 (community
    building reports: impact of development and training workshops)
    into a single yearly report.
  \item Merged together D2.3, D2.15, D2.23, and D2.24 (Demonstrators:
    Problems in Physics with Sage v1,2 , Computational Mathematics for
    Engineering).
  \item Merged together D2.8 (Community-curated indexing tool (open
    source)) and D2.9 (Community-curated indexing service for
    OpenDreamKit).
  \item Merged D2.16 (Micromagnetic VRE code and documents source
    online), D3.4 (Python interface to OOMMF completed), D4.8
    (Micromagnetic VRE software completed), D4.11 (Micromagnetic VRE
    tutorial and documentation notebooks), and D4.14 (Demonstrator
    online portal available) into a single deliverable D2.13
    (Micromagnetic VRE completed and online).
  \item Merged D3.1 and D3.9 (one-click install Sage distribution for
    Windows with Cygwin 32bit/64bit).
  \item Merged D5.1 (Facility to compile \Pythran compliant user
    kernels and sage code) and D5.3 (Improve \Pythran runtime support
    to automatically take advantage of multi-cores and SIMD
    instruction units and use it in CYTHON); also switched lead info
    for D5.3 and D5.5 (Improve PYTHRAN typing to improve error
    information).
  \item Merged D5.9 (Report on development of designs for the GAP
    developments – parallel library, interacts to standard
    infrastructure and CYTHON-like extensions) and D5.15
    (Implementations of the GAP developments, ready for release) into
    D5.18 (Final report and evaluation of the GAP developments).
  \item Merged D6.1 (DKS base survey and Requirements Workshop Report)
    and D6.3 (initial DKS base Design).
  \item Merged D6.4 (Design of Triform (DKS) Theories
    (Specification/RNC Schema/Examples)) and D6.5 (Implementation of
    Triform Theories in the MMT API).
  \item Merged D6.6 (LMFDB deep modelling: Fragment Identification and
    Initial Model Design), D6.7 (Heuristic Parser for the OEIS Import,
    Cross Validation of DKS-Model), D6.8 (Conversion of existing and
    new Databases to unified interoperable System).
  \item Merged D6.10 (Full-text search (Formulae + Keywords) over
    Notebooks) and D6.12 (Formula search in CAS programs and Software
    Modules).
  \item Merged D7.1, D7.4, D7.7 (Reports on relevant research in
    sociology of mathematics and lessons for design of OpenDreamKit
    VRE, parts I, II, III).
