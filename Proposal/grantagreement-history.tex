\subsection*{2nd amendment of the Grant Agreement, March 2017}
\ednote{insert month when ready}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Accomodate the move of the KWARC Group (Prof Michael Kohlhase) from \site{JU} to
  \site{FAU}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Addition of Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen/Nuremberg (\site{FAU}) to the
  list of beneficiaries.
\item \WPref{management}: moved 1 PM from \site{JU} to \site{FAU}.
\item \WPref{dksbases}: Made \site{FAU} lead of \WPref{dksbases} (even though JU had been
  for the initial phase), moved 34 PM and the lead of all deliverables after month 15 from
  \site{JU} to \site{FAU}.
\item \WPref{UI}: moved 8 PM and the lead of all deliverables after month 15 from
  \site{JU} to \site{FAU}.
\item Resources (Section~\ref{sec:resources}): moved the respective resources from
  \site{JU} to \site{FAU}.
\end{enumerate}
\item \WPref{dksbases}: adapted the titles of \delivref{dksbases}{psfoundation},
  \delivref{dksbases}{pssem}, and \delivref{dksbases}{lfmverif} to respect the change in
  priority on system interoperability and distributed computing in the
  ``Math-in-the-Middle'' Paradigm over algorithm verification.
\item Changed the lead of \delivref{component-architecture}{semantic-interface-sage-gap}
  from \site{UO} to \site{PS}, and the lead of \delivref{dksbases}{lfmverif} from \site{ZH} to \site{FAU}
\item Changed the lead of \site{USH} from Neil Lawrence to Michael Croucher, and the breakdown
of Person-Month to be used by this site (within the frame of the 360,00.00€ of their Personnel Costs)
\item Typo fix: \delivref{UI}{ipython-kernels} was meant to be due M24, not M14.
\item Changed the lead PI of \site{UO} from Ursula Martin to Dmitrii Pasechnik
\item Changed the lead PI of \site{SR} from Hans-Peter Langtangen to Martin A. Sandves
\item \site{UJF} changed name from Universite Joseph Fourier to Universite Grenoble Alpes
\item \site{PS} changed its PhD position of 36 PM into a Postdoc position of 24 PM
  Reduced accordingly \site{PS}'s involvement in PM's in \WPref{dksbases}.
\item Consistency fix for \site{PS}: adjusted involvement in \WPref{component-architecture} from 50~PM to 46~PM and reduced accordingly the PM's
  requested in \site{PS}'s description for research engineers: upon
  the transfer to UGent, those figures had been incorrectly updated in
  the 1st amendment.
\item Accommodate the move of Hans Fangohr from \site{USO} to
  \site{XFEL}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Addition of European XFEL GmbH/Schenefeld (\site{XFEL}) to the
  list of beneficiaries.
\item \WPref{management}: moved 1 PM from \site{USO} to \site{XFEL}.
\item \WPref{dissem}:  Moved 15 PM and the lead of all tasks to be
  completed after month 24 and the deliverable \delivref{dissem}{oommfnb-vre-deliver} from
  \site{USO} to \site{XFEL}.
\item \WPref{UI}: moved 5 PM from \site{USO} to \site{XFEL}.
\item \WPref{social-aspects}: moved deliverable D7.8 and 6 PM from
  \site{USO} to \site{XFEL}. % D7.8 is explicitly written here because
                             % it is removed in the next proposal
                             % change and we cannot refer to it
                             % anymore (MB).

\item Resources (Section~\ref{sec:resources}): moved the respective resources from
  \site{USO} to \site{XFEL}.

\item Removed 4,000 EUR for open access publication charges from
  Southampton (were by mistake omitted in submission and are thus not available).
\end{enumerate}


\item  Clarification of the CNRS site situation
\begin{enumerate}
\item Added S\'ebastien Labb\'e as a member of CNRS and removed 18 PM for
  the recruited engineer.
\item Clarification of PM repartition between CNRS and its third
  party University of Bordeaux
Removed 28,198 EUR from "Other goods and services" from
  CNRS in order to take into account modifications in Person-Months
  involved in the project. This will have no impact on the deliverables
  in which CNRS is involved.
\end{enumerate}

\item Postponment of deliverables within the first Reporting Period
\begin{enumerate}
\item \delivref{UI}{pari-python-lib1} from M6 to M18

\end{enumerate}

\item Some deliverables names in \WPref{hpc} were modified
\begin{enumerate}
\item \delivref{hpc}{MPIRsuperoptimiser} from "Extend the existingassembly superoptimiser
for AVX and upcoming Intel processor extensions for the MPIR library" to "Write an assembly
superoptimiser supporting AVX and upcoming Intel processor extensions for the MPIR library
and optimise MPIR for modern processors"
\item \delivref{hpc}{QS-linalg} from"Parallelise the relation sieving component of the
Quadratic Sieve and implement a parallel version of Block-Wiederman linear algebra over GF2
and the triple large prime variant" to "Parallelise the relation sieving component of the
Quadratic Sieve and implement a parallel version of Block-Wiederman linear algebra over GF2
and implement large prime variants"
\item \delivref{hpc}{FFT} from "Take advantage of multiple cores in the matrix Fourier Algorithm
component of the FFT for integer and polynomial arithmetic,and include assembly primitives for
SIMD processor instructions (AVX, Knight's Bridge, etc.), especially in the FFT butterflies" to
"Take advantage of multiple cores in the matrix Fourier Algorithm component of the FFT for
integer and polynomial arithmetic,and include assembly primitives for SIMD processor
instructions (e.g. AVX, etc.), especially in the FFT butterflies"
\end{enumerate}

\item  Consolidation of \WPref{UI} deliverables

Some deliverables in \WPref{UI} were consolidated and shifted.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \delivref{UI}{cfd-vis} is merged with \delivref{UI}{vis3d}, to be delivered in M36.
    The work planned is unchanged, only the merging of the reports.
\item \delivref{UI}{jupyter-import} moved from M24 to M36 to incorporate results
    from workshop on live structured documents.
\item \taskref{UI}{notebook-collab} expanded from M1-M24 to M1-M48 (the full duration of the grant)
    to reflect the ongoing nature of the work. Activity, total work, and deliverables are unchanged.
\end{enumerate}
