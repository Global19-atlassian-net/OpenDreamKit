As agreed by the Steering Committee, we are going to publish a recent (updated
to indicate various changes) version of the OpenDreamKit proposal as a paper in
https://riojournal.com/ (they already published a competing (failed) proposal
in the same EU grant call, so this really is only fair thing to do).

Due to the way RIOjournal is set up, we are going to have a long
proposal abstract published with the full proposal as an attachement.
(This would also keep their APCs low).

Files:

 * autho.txt : a draft list of authors: please have a look, and
decide whether you'd like to opt out of it, or see a particular name
added. (Please also fix name spellings etc)
The current, temporary,  order in the list is alphabetic by the given name---I
already  got requests to make it alphabetic by the family name, no need
to repeat this.
The rationale behind such a long list is that it is meant to include
everyone who made a nontrivial effort towards ODK, be it preparation of
the proposal, actual work on ODK, etc.

 * abstract.txt - to be added
