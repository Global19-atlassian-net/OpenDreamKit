The

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:wplist}, the

work plan is broken down into
seven work packages: \WPref{component-architecture} about components,
\WPref{UI} for user interfaces, \WPref{hpc} for parallelisation of the
components, \WPref{dksbases} for databases and finally
\WPref{social-aspects} for social aspects. This is complemented by the
the usual management and dissemination work packages
(\WPref{management}) and (\WPref{dissem}). The Gantt chart on
Page~\pageref{fig:gantt} illustrates the timeline for the various
tasks for these work packages%., including inter-task dependencies.

  anything like that, which would be nice, but would take too
  long. Anyway please check}

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 1: }

\taskref{component-architecture}{interface-systems} (Interfaces
between Systems) directly addresses the core of objective 1, making
existing systems compatible with one another in mathematically sound
ways. Other tasks in \WPref{component-architecture} (component
architecture) support this, by making components more portable and
easier to deploy (\taskref{component-architecture}{mod-packaging}:
Modularisation and Packaging;
\taskref{component-architecture}{portability}). \taskref{component-architecture}{extract-smc}
will bring us the benefit of lessons learned and components built for
\SMC. \taskref{dksbases}{data-design} deals with the data-centric
aspects of the interfaces. Additionally elements of \WPref{UI} (user interface) and \WPref{hpc} (HPC)
will also contribute to the framework with user interface pluggability
and interfaces optimised for HPC.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 2: }

We have identified a need for a number of new core components for
\TheProject and planned their construction at appropriate stages of
various workpackages. A new adapter infrastructure is part of
\taskref{component-architecture}{interface-systems}; new virtual
appliances will be built in
\taskref{component-architecture}{portability}; new components will be
extracted from \SMC in  \taskref{component-architecture}{extract-smc};
new documentation components will be developed in
\taskref{UI}{sage-sphinx} and \taskref{UI}{dynamic-inspect}; new
mathematical software will be developed in \taskref{hpc}{hpc-combi}
and new database tools in \taskref{dksbases}{data-memo} and \taskref{dksbases}{mws}.


\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 3: }

Representatives of a number of communities have already come together
simply to prepare this proposal, and the whole project will work to
bring them together. Specifically developers of many systems  will be brought together to complete
work package~\WPref{component-architecture},
especially~\taskref{component-architecture}{interface-systems}.
Bringing broader communities together is the core purpose of
work package~\WPref{dissem}, which includes workshops, web sites,
demonstrator packages and outreach activities.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 4: }

The concept of this project is centred on leveraging the communities
vast investment in existign open source software systems, and wherever
possible we will proceed by extending and updating existing software components.
In work package \WPref{component-architecture} we will address
portability (\taskref{component-architecture}{portability} and
modularity (\taskref{component-architecture}{extract-smc}) and also
adapt the components to use the new interfaces being designed in
\taskref{component-architecture}{interface-systems}. Work package
\WPref{hpc} is largely about updating software for performance, while
workpackage \WPref{UI} deals with adaptation of UI components and of
other systems to work with them.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 5: }

A number of tasks relate to developing promoting and supporting
sustainable models for collaborative software development. On a
practical level \taskref{component-architecture}{workflow} will adress
processes and technologies, \taskref{dksbases}{data-memo} concerns
collaborative accumulation of data. On a personal level, much of
\WPref{dissem} deals with ensuring a wide and committed user/developer
community. Finally in~\taskref{social-aspects}{isocial-decisionmaking}
we will actually conduct research into the social mechanisms of
collaborative software development, and lessons from this research
will be embedded into the structures we leave behind.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 6: }

Objective 6 is covered by a dedicated work package \WPref{social-aspects} on social aspects.
It ranges from analysis of the needs with~\taskref{social-aspects}{social-input} to
evaluation with~\taskref{social-aspects}{oommf-nb-evaluation}.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 7: }

Objective 7 is addressed directly by \WPref{dksbases}, which deals with data
and its meaning.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 8: }

Producing and evaluating systems that demonstrate our achievements is
a key feature of this project, and this work in embedded throughout
the project. The integration and publicisation of these demonstrators
is key to \WPref{dissem} (dissemination) especially later in the
project, while their formal evaluation is found in \WPref{social-aspects}.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 9: }

Dissemination is the heart of~\WPref{dissem}.
Members of \TheProject will organise workshops within \taskref{dissem}{dissemination}
or \taskref{dissem}{project-intro} as well as less formal meetings
with interested groups. In addition, we will follow open software development
processes throughout the project, so that our work is immediately
available to any interested party. We will announce important
developments or releases through our own web pages and the
established channels of the component systems. Our scientific findings
will be published in the open scientific literature and announced at
scientific meetings and conferences in the usual way and reported in
annual project reports.


\subsubsection{Work Plan Timing: GANTT Chart showing Task Dependencies and Information
  Flows}

Since \TheProject consists mainly in improving independent tools and
integrating them into a VRE, its tasks are fairly independent from each
other, which is reflected by the GANTT chart in Figure~\ref{fig:gantt}
