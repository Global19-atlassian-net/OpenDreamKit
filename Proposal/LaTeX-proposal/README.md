LaTeX-proposal:  A set of LaTeX classes for preparing proposals for collaborative projects
==============

The base proposal class supports many of the general elements of project proposals. It is
optimized towards collaborating on writing project proposals. This class is intended to be
specialized to particular funding bodies that have their own styles.

* ```base```: the base proposal class ([documentation](https://github.com/KWARC/LaTeX-proposal/tree/master/base/proposal.pdf))
* ```dfg```: the instance for Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ([documentation](https://github.com/KWARC/LaTeX-proposal/tree/master/dfg/dfgproposal.pdf), [examples](https://github.com/KWARC/LaTeX-proposal/tree/master/dfg/examples))
* ```eu```: the instance for EU proposals ([documentation](https://github.com/KWARC/LaTeX-proposal/tree/master/eu/euproposal.pdf), [examples](https://github.com/KWARC/LaTeX-proposal/tree/master/eu/examples))
* ```etc```: style files from the sTeX bundle added for convenience (only on GitHub, not on CTAN)
* ```lib```: Makefiles for the management of self-documenting packages
* ```bin```: utilities, e.g. a script that makes GitHub issues from the deliverables of a proposal for project managment if the proposal is granted.
