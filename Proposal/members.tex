\subsection{Third Parties Involved in the Project (including use of third party resources)}
\label{section:ThirdParties}

\paragraph{CNRS}\ 

\eucommentary{Please complete, for each participant, the table
(see page 27 of "VRETemplate.PDF"),
or simply state "No third parties involved", if applicable.}

The University of Bordeaux will be involved as a Third Party Linked to CNRS.
Indeed, both the LaBRI and the IMB are Joint Research Units for which both the
University of Bordeaux and CNRS are supervisory authorities ; Karim Belabas and
Adrien Boussicault are staff of the University of Bordeaux and actively
participate in the project (see~\ref{desc:Bordeaux}).
The University of
Bordeaux was founded in the 15th century and nowadays the city hosts two
universities, dozens of schools and 100 research laboratories with partner
institutions such as CNRS, Inserm, INRA and INRIA. It is an important centre of
studies and research in France with approximately 50,000 students, 2,000 PhD
students and 5,000 researchers.
