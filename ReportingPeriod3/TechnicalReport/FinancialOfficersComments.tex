Justifications required for the following comments of the financial officers 

for UPSud:
- The partner has claimed unforeseen equipment costs and unforeseen costs for an
implementation contract. A justification should be included in the Technical Report.

We worked with PIX VIDEOS to produce a high quality motion graphics video for
the project OpenDreamKi. This expense was not foreseen in the Annex 1 but following the
recommendation of The project officer and the referees during our First review meeting, we decided to
make an explainer video about our project. Futhermore, it seemed like a good opportunity to communicate
our project, to promote the action and its results by providing understandable information to a non
specialist audience.

Before the project begins, we used the free version of the SAGEMATH software. But
during the first year of the project,it appeared to us that in order to assess it on a large scale, it would
be preferable to use the extended version.

- Overspending by 97.22% (8.75PM) in WP2 and underspending by 46.32% (11.58PM) in WP6.
Please explain these deviations in the Technical Report.

for CNRS:
The partner is underspending significantly in WP1 and WP4 and overspending by 96.43% in
WP5. Please explain these deviations in the Technical Report.

for UB (Third party of beneficiary CNRS):
The partner has claimed effort in WP1 and WP4 in which they are not active. These costs are
not eligible unless properly explained in the Technical Report.

%CFS for 407,695.18 euro direct costs; and 509,618.98 euro total is NOT SIGNED; the indicated cost of the certificate refers to the amount of the direct costs, instead shall be zero, please correct it; the attached auditors guidelines refer to another project: Grant Agreement number: 681044 –RESSTORE – H2020-PHC-2014-2015/H2020-PHC-2015-single-stage_RTD, please use those for OpenDreamKit Project and they shall be signed by the auditor The ToR signed by both parties is missing.ALREADY DEALT WITH BY THE ADMIN
- Please confirm that the adjustment amount of 10,859.29€ from RP1 is related to costs and not
effort. No explanation provided for other direct costs declared in RP2.

Significant underspending in the use of the budget for other direct costs. In addition to less faceto-
face meetings and travel costs resp, there must be other reason(s) for this deviation.

in the Technical Report.

for UVSQ:
The partner is overspending in WP2 by 137.50% and has declared costs in WP6 in which they
are not active. These costs are not eligible unless properly described in the Technical Report.

 UVSQ claiming effort in WP6 is due to Luca De Feo spending 5 hours on WP6 from April 24th to 28th, 2017. He helped Michael 
 Kolhase's team (from FAU) to prepare the WP6 presentations. The benefits of his collaboration are here:

for UWarwick:
The partner has claimed effort in WP5 in which they are not active. These costs are not eligible
unless properly described in the Technical Report.
UWarwich has mistankenly declared costs in WP5, the FS declaration has been corrected and effort has been claimend only in WP1 and WP6.

The actual average personnel costs are significantly higher than planned, 
please clarify the reasons for this deviations (besides the currency exchange rate fluctuation).

for Logilab:
%CFS to be produced. 
The partner is underspending in WP5 by 95.83% and has a declared a
higher monthly average rate (7,889.82 vs. 5,937.75).The actual average personnel costs are significantly higher than planned, 
please clarify the reasons for this deviations.

For the WP5, Logilab subcontracted its work to Serge Guelton (12 PM) and thus  did not charge regular direct personnel costs for this work package. Nevertheless, the partner has declared the subcontracting costs in line (d).

face meetings and travel costs resp, there must be other reason(s) for this deviation


for Simula:
The partner should explain the underspending in WP2 and the overspending in WP4 in the
Technical Report. The partner has also declared a much lower monthly rate (6,607.88 vs. 10,085.28). Please explain in the Technical Report.

face meetings and travel costs resp, there must be other reason(s) for this deviation

The first project-related reason was shifting person-months from senior staff with high salaries
to postdoctoral and research engineer staff.
This was caused by a combination of senior staff departing Simula
and the presence of experienced personnel at lower salary rates.
Additionally, exchange rate fluctuations between Norwegian kroner and Euros contributed
to person months being significantly less costly than in the original budget.
The result was a cost-effective expenditure of person months,
delivering more mature results in Work Package 4,
without incurring any additional cost.

for JacobsUni:

please clarify the reasons for this deviations (besides the currency exchange rate fluctuation).

for FAU:
in the FS we need a confirmation that the adjusted amount is related to costs and not effort.
The partner should explain the 76.94% overspending in terms of effort in WP6. The partner
is also using a much lower monthly average rate. These deviations should be explained in the
Technical Report.

FAU hired students to do
some routine jobs (simple formalizations, mathematical data curation, interface work for
MathHub.info) that did not require the attention of a mature researchers. As the pay grade
of student assistant is roughly 1/4 of that of full researchers, this action was
cost-effective. An unplanned effect was that the reported person months went up
considerably, exceeding the planned amount, without incurring additional cost.

%Waiting for final submission.
Significant underspending in the use of the budget for other direct costs. In addition to less faceto-
face meetings and travel costs resp, there must be other reason(s) for this deviation.
