There is a generally accepted consensus in the Mathematical community
on sharing data, and the OpenDreamKit team members are long time
proponents of the FAIR principles. In addition, by nature, ethical
issues are nonexistent. Finally, \emph{producing} data was not at the
core of OpenDreamKit; in particular, we did not produce huge data sets
requiring expensive infrastructure just to store them. The preparation
of the original Data Management Plan during Reporting Period 1
(\longdelivref{management}{data-plan1}) was therefore straightforward.
Only marginal updates were required during Reporting Period 2
(\longdelivref{management}{data-plan2}) and this latest version
remains adequate for this last reporting period: only a few additional
data sets have been produced or curated during the project, and are
hosted and disseminated under the same FAIR conditions. The process
was eased by the semantic data management facilities in LMFDB and \dmh
(a from-scratch mathematical dataset hosting/search/management system;
see WP6 description).
