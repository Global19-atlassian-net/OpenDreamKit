\section{Update of the Data Management Plan}

A second version of the Data Management Plan was released in
\longdelivref{management}{data-plan2}. Up to minor updates to the list
of data sets, there was no change since
\longdelivref{management}{data-plan1}.

\begin{newpart}{MK: I am putting this here, even though there is no Data Management Plan
    V3}
  With the semantic data management facilities in LMFDB and \dmh (a from-scratch dataset
  hosting/search/management system), we now have another option for
  hosting mathematical datasets in mathematical VREs. The \pn project could use these for
  hosting its own mathematical data sets.
