This document is meant as an internal draft for the project's Technical
Report for Reporting Period 2. As such, it provides an overview of the
project achievements, by objectives, work packages, and tasks from March
2017 to August 2018, and their impact. It also explains how reviewer's
recommendations were tackled and discusses risk and quality management
and deviations from the original plan. We recommend to read directly the
technical report itself.
