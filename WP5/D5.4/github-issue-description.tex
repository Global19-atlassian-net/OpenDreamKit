Pythran is a Python to C++ compiler for a subset of the Python language,
with a focus on scientific computing, which takes advantage of
multi-cores and SIMD instruction units. Given the importance of Python
in the OpenDreamKit ecosystem, Pythran is one of the promising building
blocks for high performance mathematical computing.

This deliverable is about enhancing the Pythran compiler to provide
better user feedback when a type error is meet, by extracting and taking
advantage of fine grain type information. The optimizations developed in
this context are a more accurate version of identifier binding that
increases the scope of Pythran valid input. Second, an unsound type
checker has been developed and integrated in the 0.8 version of the
Pythran compiler. It provides usable, meaningful feedback to users in
case of type error, instead of internal compiler errors. These two steps
make it easier to write computation-intensive kernels to be compiled by
Pythran.
