# Context
Computational linear algebra is a key tool delivering high computing throughput to applications requiring large scale computations. In numerical computing, dealing with floating point arithmetic and approximations, a long history of efforts has lead to the design of a full stack of technology for numerical HPC: from the design of stable and fast algorithms, to their implementation in standardized libraries such as LAPACK and BLAS, and their parallelization on shared memory servers or supercomputers with distributed memory.

On the other hand, computational mathematics relies on linear algebra with exact arithmetic, i.e. multiprecision integers and rationals, finite fields, etc. This leads to significant differences in the algorithmic and implementations approaches. Over the last 20 years, a continuous stream of research has improved the exact linear algebra algorithmic; simultaneously, software projects such as LinBox and fflas-ffpack were created to deliver a similar set of kernel linear algebra routines as LAPACK but for exact arithmetic. 

The parallelization of these kernels has only been partially addressed in the past, and was mostly focused on shared memory architectures.

# Goal of the deliverable
This deliverable aims at enhancing these libraries so that they can exploit various large scale parallel architectures, including large multi-cores, clusters, and accelerators. The target application is the solver of linear systems of the field of multi-precision rational numbers. For this application, several algorithmic approaches will be studied and experimented, namely a Chinese Remainder based solver and a p-adic lifting solver. The former exposes a much higher level of parallelism in its tasks, while the latter requires asymptotically  much fewer operations.
