\section{Algorithmic aspect}

Solving exactly over the field of rational numbers, requires a careful attention to the size of the numbers being
manipulated. Indeed, rational numbers are represented by a pair of multiprecision integers, a numerator and
denominator. Applying the standard direct methods designed for solving approximately systems with floating point
rational numbers would lead to a blowup in the bitsize of the coefficients, and result in overwelming computation
overheads, with time complexities often not even polynomial.

\subsection{State of the art}
%% \TODO{clarify from the onset that the following paragraph is about
%%   literature, not work done here (right?)}

In a series of algorithmic innovations, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:complexities}, the time complexity for solving exactly a linear system over the rationals has
been reduced to $\SO{n^3}$ or $\SO{n^\omega}$ which is asymptotically as fast as the complexity for solving
approximately using floating point numbers.

First, the use of rational reconstruction makes it possible to recover the rational solution from the solution of the same
system projected into a large enough finite field.
This approach avoids the  swell in the bitsize of the intermediate computations and compute with the arithmetic precision of the output for a total cost of $\GO{n^5}$.
Then, using  multi-modular representation and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, reduces this cost  to $\SO{n^4}$.
This cost, corresponding to the arithmetic complexity of Gaussian elimination multiplied by the bitsize of the output,
is sub-optimal. By better balancing the computation load between numerous arithmetic operation on small bitsize and
few operations on large bitsize, one can hope to further reduce this complexity. This is achieved by $p$-adic lifting
techniques~\cite{Dix82}, reaching a $\SO{n^3}$ time complexity. Improving the complexity for this problem is still a
very active topic: \cite{Sto05} reduced it to $\SO{n^\omega}$ using randomization, and the same
complexity can now be reached deterministically since this year~\cite{BLS19}.

\begin{tabular}{lc}
  \toprule
  Method  & Bit complexity \\
  \midrule
  Gauss over $\mathbb{Q}$ & $2^{\GO{n}}$ \\
  Gauss $\mod \text{bound}(sol)$ & $\GO{n^5}$\\
  CRT $\times$ Gauss $\mod p$ & $\SO{n^4}, \SO{n^\omega+1}$\\
  $p$-adic lifting & $\SO{n^3}, \SO{n^\omega}$\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Brief overview of algorithmic innovations for solving linear systems over the rationals}\label{tab:complexities}
\end{table}

While $p$-adic lifting techniques achieve the best complexity for sequential computations, they are unfortunately very
iterative in their structure, and therefore harder to parallelize at a large scale. On the contrary, Chinese remainder
based methods offer an embarrassingly parallel structure, but cost a factor of $n$ more. We have therefore chosen to
explore both approaches which will be described in the following subsections.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%ùù
\subsection{The Chinese remainder approach}

We recall here the principle of the Chinese Remainder based rational solver:
the linear system over the integers is reduced modulo a series of prime numbers. Each of these systems can then be solved
independently, therefore exposing a large degree of parallelism. The rational solution can then be recovered in two
phases by a Chinese remainder reconstruction followed by a vector rational reconstruction.

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
  \caption{Chinese Remainder based rational solver}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Require{$\mat{A}\in \mathbb{Z}^{n\times n},\vect{b}\in\mathbb{Z}^n$}
    \Ensure{$\vect{x}$ such that $\mat{A}\vect{x}=\vect{b}$}
    \State $N,D \leftarrow \text{SolutionBounds}(\mat{A},b)$
    \State Pick $\ell$ primes $p_1,\dots, p_\ell$ such that $\prod_{i=1}^\ell p_i \geq 2ND$
    \For{$i\leftarrow 1\dots \ell$}
    \State $\mat{A}^{(i)} \leftarrow \mat{A}\mod p_i$
    \State $\vect{b}^{(i)} \leftarrow \vect{b}\mod p_i$
    \State $\vect{x}^{(i)} \leftarrow (\mat{A}^{(i)})^{-1} \vect{b}^{(i)} \mod p_i$
    \EndFor
  \State $\vect{y} \leftarrow \texttt{ChineseRemainder}(\vect{y}^{(1)},p_1,\dots, \vect{y}^{(\ell)},p_\ell)$
  \State $\vect{x},d\leftarrow \texttt{VectorRationalReconstruction}(\vect{y},\prod_{i=1}^\ell p_i)$
  \State \Return $\vect{x}/d$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

In sequential versions of this algorithm, the Chinese remainder and rational reconstruction can be performed on the fly
after each iteration, in order to detect stabilization and allow to terminate the loop earlier than what the possibily
pessimistic bound on the solution requires. In parallel, this would generate depency between the parallel tasks and we
thus chose to disable this feature.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%ùù
\subsection{The $p$-adic lifting approach}

The $p$-adic lifting approach, developped in~\cite{Dix82} is based on a Newton iteration to compute iteratively the
digits in the $p$-adic expansion of the solution vector. This algorithm manages to reduce the cost of Chinese Remaindering
by balancing two types of operations: expensive linear algebra (matrix inverse or LU decomposition) is
perfomed only once over in small precision (a finite field) while the high precision part of the computation is
contained in a sequence of less expensive linear algebra operations (matrix-vector products).
%\begin{algorithm}[htb]
%  \caption{$p$-adic lifting based rational solver}
%  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
%    \Require{$\mat{A}\in \mathbb{Z}^{n\times n},\vect{b}\in\mathbb{Z}^n$}
%    \Ensure{$\vect{x}$ such that $\mat{A}\vect{x}=\vect{b}$}
%    \State $N,D \leftarrow \text{SolutionBounds}(\mat{A},b)$
%    \State Pick a prime $p$. Let $k$ such that $p^k \geq 2ND$
%    \State $\mat{B}\leftarrow \mat{A}^{-1} \mod p$
%    \State $\vect{r}\leftarrow \vect{b}$
%    \For{$i\leftarrow 0\dots k$}
%    \State $\vect{c}^{(i)}  \leftarrow \mat{B} \vect{r} \mod p_i$
%    \State $\vect{r} \leftarrow  \frac{\vect{r} - \mat{A}\vect{x_i}}{p}$
%    \EndFor
%    \State $\vect{y} \leftarrow \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \vect{c}^{(i)} p^i$
%    \State $\vect{x},d\leftarrow \texttt{VectorRationalReconstruction(\vect{y})}$
%  \State \Return $\vect{x}/d$
%\end{algorithmic}
%\end{algorithm}

However, the strongly iterative structure of this algorithm makes it both harder to parallelize and less cache
efficient.
In \cite{ChSt05}, Storjohann and Chen devised a way to improve the cache efficiency thanks to a hybrid combination of
$p$-adic lifting and Chinese remainder techniques. 
This led to a multi-modular (or RNS, residue number system) $p$-adic
lifting.
We further improve this variant in several ways to deliver a parallel
RNS $p$-adic lifting solver. Algorithm~\ref{alg:ParMultiModSolve} reflects
these improvements with the two following salient features:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The costly updates in the main loop of \cite{ChSt05} were
  performed via matrix-vector arbitrary precision multiplications over
  the integers with a second RNS basis.
  We instead gather those updates in order to perform instead a
  matrix-matrix multiplication. 
  This can be seen in line~\ref{lin:ZGEMM} of
  Algorithm~\ref{alg:ParMultiModSolve}.
\item We mix this algorithm with the parallel RNS improvement
  of~\cite{DGLS18} and restrict the second RNS basis to primes
  individually larger than the 
  multi-modular high-level ones in order to speed up the RNS/integer
  conversions. 
\end{enumerate}
