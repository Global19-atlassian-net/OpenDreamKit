It is common for academic High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters to make use of schedulers based on Sun Grid Engine with Son of Grid Engine as one of the most popular. It is used, for example, on the institutional HPC systems in the Universities of Sheffield and Manchester in the UK. It is also used on the regional N8 HPC facility, a system shared by the 8 most research intensive universities in the North of England.
In this deliverable, we have developed and demonstrated a Sun Grid Engine notebook spawner for Project Jupyter, allowing users to easily access Jupyter notebooks on HPC clusters directly from the web-browser. This development allows users with no background in High Performance Computing to easily migrate workflows from laptop to HPC cluster, allowing them to access greater resources with no additional training required.
