The Python programming language, widely used in the development of
computational mathematics software for its flexibility, yet suffers from the
inefficiencies due its nature of interpreted language. Cython is both an extension of
this language, and a compiler producing compilable C code, delivering
performances of higher standard.
The use of the very widespread library NumPy is a bottlneck in this framework,
as it prevents the user from taking advantage of Cython's improvement.
Similarly Pythran is a dedicated Python to C++ compiler dedicated for the
optimization of Numpy code.

This deliverable hence proposes to incorporate Pythran's support for Numpy code
wihtin Cython, which consequently will provide high performance numerical linear
algebra to high level mathematical software developpers, especially in the
SageMath software.
