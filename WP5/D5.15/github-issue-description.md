[GAP ("Groups, Algorithms, Programming'')](https://www.gap-system.org/) is a software system for computational discrete mathematics, with its origins in finite group theory. The system has been developed continually since 1986, with the first public release in 1988. Throughout its life it has been made available free of charge for use, extension and non-commercial redistribution. It is widely used by researchers in mathematics, computer science and other disciplines, and has been cited in [more than 3000 research publications](https://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Bib/bib.html). It is also widely [used in teaching](https://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Teaching/teaching.html). GAP is also used as a component of other mathematical software systems such as [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) and [OSCAR](https://oscar.computeralgebra.de).

This report describes the work undertaken in connection with [Task 5.2](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/100): a wide range of developments within the GAP system to meet the general objective of [workpackage 5](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/labels/WP5) ("improve the performance of the computational components of OpenDreamKit"). We have worked on supporting the use of a range of High Performance Computing environments, prioritizing those most accessible to our users, namely multi-core systems, adding to our existing support for clusters and cloud computing. We have also made fundamental performance improvements and improvements to our tools, processes and to the programming language, that benefit all GAP users.

A collection of GAP Jupyter notebooks, together with the setup to execute them on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), is available at https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/gap-demos.
