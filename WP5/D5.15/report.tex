\section{Developments in the core\GAP system}\label{core-gap}

This Section highlights some of the most important and relevant
changes to the core \GAP system incorporated in the new \GAP releases
published during the project. Other important developments are
included in \GAP packages and described in later sections.  More
detailed descriptions of each major and minor \GAP release, with links
to the corresponding source code changes on GitHub, are contained in
the ``GAP - Changes from Earlier Versions'' document, which is
redistributed with \GAP and also available on the \GAP website at
\url{https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/changes/chap0.html} and
included as an appendix to this report. This
work includes contributions from our external collaborators, whose
authorship can be seen from the version control history.
\TODO{Remember to add Changes manual as an appendix}

\subsection{\GAP 4.8 (February 2016)}\label{gap-4.8}

\GAP 4.8 was the first major release of \GAP published
after the start of the OpenDreamKit project.
As a preparation for the future developments to support multithreading, 
some language extensions from the HPC-\GAP project were backported to the 
\GAP library to help to unify the codebase of both \GAP 4 and HPC-\GAP. 

In addition, it also provided support for much enhanced
profiling. Previously \GAP\ allowed tracking of the CPU spent
executing each function, but the new features in
the core system reduced the granularity of this to individual lines of
\GAP code. Related developments also made it easier to track time
spent on individual lines of C code in the \GAP kernel. A related
feature makes it easy to measure ``test coverage'' -- the proportion
of the system that has actually been executed by a given set of
tests. The {\sf Profiling} package by
Christopher Jefferson (St Andrews) provided excellent tools for transforming these profiles
into various human-readable forms. These features 
supported later  work on enhancing both the performance and the
reliability of \GAP, through easier identification of hot-spots and
easier measurement of test quality.

This release also included some language extensions which would allow users to write
more efficient and readable code:
\begin{itemize}
  \item support for \emph{partially
  variadic functions} similar to those allowed in Python, allowing
function expressions like
\verb|function( a, b, c, x... ) ... end;|
which requires at least three arguments \verb|a|, \verb|b| and
\verb|c| and assigns
\item more flexible list indexing, allowing users to install methods
  for multiple indexing   (\verb|m[i,j]| instead of \verb|m[i][j]| for arrays) and more varied
  indexes (such as \verb|l[-1]| for a doubly-infinite virtual list. As
  well as being more flexible, this was a step towards supporting more
  efficient array implementations  in which ``row objects'' (like
  \verb|m[i]| in \verb|m[i][j]|) might not exist.
\end{itemize}

\GAP 4.8 had seven public releases between February 2016 and August 2017, and
was replaced by \GAP 4.9.

\subsection{\GAP 4.9 (May 2018)}\label{gap-4.9}

\GAP 4.9 continued the restructuring and modernising of the core \GAP
system. Aiming at the greater reliability, flexibility and performance
which would needed for \GAP to take full advantage of the \ODK ecosystem.
For example, we removed our old home-grown large integer arithmetic
implementation, and instead always 
use the state of the art external library \href{???}{GMP}. This
continues our cautious move to take more advantage of existing free
software libraries in the core system. We do this cautiously, based on
our experience,  so that we can maintain the reliability and
portability of \GAP on which our users depend.

Also for portability reasons, this release incorporated a  completely
reimplemented build system for \GAP, using more modern tools and
complying with modern expectations. This resolved many issues with the old
system, and made it easier to maintain and extend. Technical details
of the new build system are described in {\tt README.buildsys.md} from
the \GAP source code. 

This also enabled us to merge the experimental code to support safe multithreaded programming in \GAP, 
dubbed HPC-\GAP, into the mainstream \GAP system as a compile-time option (for details, see
Subsection~\ref{hpc-gap}).

This release also incorporated many smaller performance improvements. For example,
\GAP now supports named constants, whose value cannot change 
at runtime. While maintaining readability through naming, uses of
these constants can be optimised as a function is parsed, so that they
are as fast as using explicit values. Another notable improvement was
to the widely used  sorting functions which have been improved using
recently published algorithms and made more maintainable by
restructuring the implementation.

Debugging  tools were improved: in many cases \GAP now outputs the
source filename  and location from which relevant code was originally
read as well as simply printing the lines of code or names of functions.

Further enhancements to the profiling system based on experience with
\GAP 4.8 were also included, as were additional changes improving \GAP
usability by allowing more
efficient and/or readable code,
\begin{itemize}
  \item a concise syntax for short
functions with any number of arguments such as \verb|{a,b} -> a+b| replacing \verb|function(a,b) return a+b; end|. 
\item use of function literals in expressions such \verb|y := f().x;|
replacing previously required two-step calculation \verb|y := f();; y := y.x;|.
\end{itemize}

\GAP 4.9 had three public releases between May and September 2019, and
was replaced by \GAP 4.10.

\subsection{\GAP 4.10 (November 2018)}\label{gap-4.10}

The release of \GAP 4.9 with the new build system allowed a
further restructuring of the core \GAP system to continue, and allowed
us to finalise a number of other ongoing changes, 
 resulting in the 
next major release just a few months later. \GAP 4.10 is current version
of \GAP, with the latest release being \GAP 4.10.2, published in June
2019 and \GAP 4.11 expected in September 2019.

The most important new feature in \GAP 4.10 was \texttt{libGAP} an
option to compile \GAP as a C library instead of a stand-alone
executable. This is discussed more in section \ref{libgap} below.

\GAP 4.10 also provides experimental support for using alternative
memory management systems, notably the \href{??}{Julia} garbage
collector and the \href{???}{Boehm garbage collector} in place of
the GASMAN system which was developed for \GAP 4 in the 1990s.
These garbage collectors are thread-safe (important for \HPCGAP) the
links to Julia are
motivated by a desire to allow tight integration with \GAP and Julia 
in the future, led by the \href{https://oscar.computeralgebra.de/}{OSCAR}
project, developed within the DFG-funded grant SFB-TRR 195
``Symbolic Tools in Mathematics and their Application''.

The work on improving debugging and profiling in \GAP was
continued. Profiling now covers memory usage as well as CPU time, and
additional checking options (internal and using external tools such as
\href{???}{valgrind}) help to detect misuse of memory in the kernel.

Using the improved debugging and profiling facilities we were able to detect many
performance bottlenecks and confirm that new code was both correct and
genuinely improved performance.
For example, the method selection code was rewritten from \GAP to C;
Speed ups were achieved for many integer arithmetic functions such as
\verb|GcdInt|, \verb|LcmInt|, \verb|PValuation|, 
\verb|RootInt|, \verb|SmallestRootInt|, \verb|IsPrimePowerInt|
and the computation of modular inverses of integers.

For example, the table below gives the timing in milliseconds required
for the folowing loop: \verb|for i in [1..k] do x:= 1/p^q mod n; od|

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c | c | c |} 
\hline
p & q    & n          & k        & ms, before & ms, after \\
3 & 60   & $2^{59}$   & 2000000  & 2364       & 1219 \\
3 & 60   & $2^{60}$   & 2000000  & 2821       & 1292 \\
2 & 6000 & $3^{6000}$ & 6000     & 19358      & 692  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

%692

Also, \verb|InverseMatMod| with integer modulus has been improved:% #2426

\TODO{convert into a table}

\end{verbatim}
}

{\small

gap> m2:=RandomUnimodularMat(100);;

1249
gap> for i in [1..100] do x:=InverseMatMod(m2,65537); od; time;
1226
\end{verbatim}

}

The same improved profiling tools allowed us to identify other
``hidden'' bottlenecks in \GAP code. For instance \GAP has a
sophisticated system of inference that can trigger 
so-called ``immediate methods'': quick attempts to deduce additional
consequnces from information that becomes known about an object.
In general, these are very effective, and the deduced information can
lead the system to chose better methods for subsequent
calculations. As an example arises when a group learns its order, we
can check if that order is finite and odd, and if so, thanks to the celebrated
Feit-Thomson theorem, conclude that the group is solvable. Once that
is known, much more efficient methods can be applied for many
subsequent calculations.

While this is a very powerful feature in most situations, there can be
rare examples where a large number of short-lived objects are created,
and the immediate methods use a great deal of time deducing knowledge
that will never be used. The profiling developments made this 
easily visible for the first time, and some small adjustments to the
immediate methods produced up to a six-fold speed up in fundamental
operations such as computing isomorphism groups. For instance the
run-time for the code fragment below on a test system dropped from 130
seconds to 22.


{\small
\begin{verbatim}
G:=PcGroupCode( 
  741231213963541373679312045151639276850536621925972119311,
  11664);;
IsomorphismGroups(G,PcGroupCode(CodePcGroup(G),Size(G)))<>fail;
\end{verbatim}
}


\subsection{\GAP 4.11 (anticipated in November 2019)}\label{gap-4.11}

% Since they are released on GitHub, I see no reason not to also
% highlight changes which are merged and definitely coming out in
% 4.11, if they are relevant SL

% Release notes are collected at https://github.com/gap-system/gap/wiki/GAP-4.11-release-notes

At the time of preparation of this report the next major release \GAP
4.11 is approaching completion. Almost all of the features to be
included in it (including all the ones highlighted here) are already
publicly  available on GitHub to developers or anyone else interested.

This will feature the first release of the ``syntaxtree'' reflection
API for \GAP, allowing \GAP to access and modify the internals of \GAP
functions, opening up a range of possibilities for optmisation, automatic
parallelisation, and more effective compilation into C. This is
discussed in more detail in section \ref{syntaxtree} below. 

Additional relevant features are continued improvements to debugging and
profiling facilities \TODO{maybe some examples} extensions to the
\texttt{libGAP} API to allow programs using the system in this way
more convenient access to \GAP objects; and a range of performance
enhancements.

\TODO{is there more?}

% What about making pages for relevant releases in

\subsection{lib\GAP: allowing 3rd party code to link \GAP as a library}\label{libgap}

The initial connection between \Sage and \GAP was developed around
2006, and relied on running a full \GAP process with which \Sage
communicated through pipes, creating \GAP input as text and parsing
the text output by \GAP. This enabled an initial connection, but
introduced considerable overhead coverting objects to and from text
representations and passing them between processes.

A better solution is to provide a C API enabling \GAP to be integrated
into the \Sage process, and allowing a \GAP session to be started,
objects created, functions called and results retrieved via C function
calls. This is, however, not a mode of operation for which \GAP was
ever designed, and implementing it in a robust and flexible way
required considerable adaptations to the system, for instance to make
sure it never tried to access the terminal. Based on an iniital
version developed within the \Sage team, a fully general-purpose and
flexible version was released in  \GAP 4.10.0 (November 2018).

Subsequent releases have improved and will continue to improve the
robustness of lib\GAP, and to extend its API with new functionality (See Chapter 2 
``Changes between \GAP 4.9 and \GAP 4.10'' of the 
``\GAP - Changes from Earlier Versions'' manual for the detailed
descriptions). This has allowed \Sage to drop its custom 
modifications to \GAP and use an official, documented and regularly 
tested \GAP interface instead, starting from SageMath 8.6 (January
2019).

% See SageTrac ticket 22626 made that happen; it was merged in 
% SageMath 8.6.beta0, so SageMath 8.6 had it but not SageMath 8.5.

\section{High-performance computing with \GAP}\label{hpc}

\subsection{HPC-\GAP: multithreaded programming in \GAP}\label{hpc-gap}

\GAP 4.9.1 (May 2018) for the first time included experimental code to 
support safe multithreaded programming in \GAP, dubbed \HPCGAP. This
has been in development for some time, and the \HPCGAP and \GAP
codebases had diverged. In this release we unified the codebases,
making thread support a compile-time option instead of completely
different programme. This was an essential step to support further development of 
HPC-\GAP, and ensure that new developments in \GAP could be quickly
incorporated.
It also provided users an opportunity to start to experiment 
with \HPCGAP, for which documentation is also provided.

\HPCGAP supports two models of parallel programming in \GAP, which can
be combined: threads and tasks. Threads operate as in most languages,
teh basic primitive is to start execution of a \GAP function in a new
thread, while the calling thread returns immediately. Threads can
interact through global data or by returning results when they exit. Tasks are
similar, but they are submitted to a shared job queue and executed by
one of a fixed-size pool of worker threads. Typically the calling
process will start a number of threads and then wait for somne or all
of them to complete.  Supporting this requires considerable work on
the \GAP interpreter, but is otherwise straightforward.

The challenge
however is that the \GAP library makes very extensive use of shared
global data, which is frequently updated as new knowledge is
obtained. Ensuring that access and updates to this data from different
threads and tasks does not cause corruption or inconsistency was the
main challenge. The approach taken was to limit access, in most cases,
to data ``owned'' by the accessing thread; read-only data and
``public'' data stored in thread-safe data structures. This is
implemented by access checks in the kernel with the aim of ensuring
that most unsafe data access should result in error messages, rather
than inconsistent results. Experiments with this system have been
reported in a number of papers.

The main remaining challenge is to adapt the enormous legacy codebase
represented by \GAP's library and key packages to use these mechanisms
effectively, and to keep the underlying mechanisms working as the core
\GAP codebase evolves. Fusing the codebases, as was done in \GAP 4.10
was a critical step in this work, meaning, for instance, that all
changes to \GAP are tested in \HPCGAP automatically.

\section{meataxe64: high-performance linear algebra over finite fields}\label{meataxe64}

A key kernel for many applications of \GAP is linear algebra over
a wide range of finite fields. This is used directly in working with
matrix groups and in computational representation theory, but also
arises indirectly in areas such as graph theory, finite solvable
groups and number theory. The \GAP kernel includes memory-efficient
representations of matrices over these fields, and implementations
based on the C-meataxe (the name ``meataxe'' is derived from the
abbreviation ``mtx'' for ``matrix'' and the fact that a key operation
in computational representation theory is to ``chop'' a module into
its irreducible components) from the late 1980s.

Working with external collaborators (primarily Richard Parker),
we have contributed to the design and development (and continue to extend) of a new C and
assembler library, called ``meataxe64'' which takes
advantage of new algorithmic ideas, and of powerful features of new
CPUs to deliver a quantum leap in performance. We have implemented a
\GAP interface to it (the ``meataxe64 \GAP package'') currently in
beta-test, and are in the
process of revising higher levels of the software stack to make best
use of it.

\section{Regression testing, Package management and Release management}\label{gap-infra}

In this section we will describe mostly the technical aspects of
ensuring that all developments are becoming available to users.
The social aspects such as community building, user training
and technical support will be described in Section~\ref{gap-support}.

\subsection{Regression testing}\label{testing}

\emph{Regression testing} is a software engineering technique which uses
a set of tests to check (preferably in some automated way)
that new changes do not break the functionality that used to 
work previously. If a change breaks the test, that is called 
a \emph{regression}. In \GAP, regressions may occur, for example,
when a change causes an incorrect result, or a crash, or an error
message; in addition, there may be \emph{performance regressions}
and \emph{memory regressions}.

GAP regression testing uses \emph{integration tests} - these are
the tests when different parts of the \GAP functionality are 
exercised in the same \GAP session (opposite to \emph{unit tests}
which exercise each logical unit of the code separately, but do
not necessarily test interactions between them).\comment{Is this true?
  -- all tests are with an integrated system, but increasingly, each
  test covers narrow functionality}
The \GAP test
suite for the core system consists of a total of 707 test files at the time of writing
totalling over $60\,000$ lines,
as well as of the tests that check the correctness of over
over $14,000$ lines of 1810 manual examples.
\comment{1336 mansections containing examples;
1641 (ref) + 169 (tut) = 1810 examples;

In addition many packages have large test suites.
% and some further code in the {\tt benchmarks} directory. 

\GAP is also redistributed with a number of extensions, called \GAP packages
(145 in the latest release \GAP 4.10.2). These packages may, for example,
extend mathematical functionality of the system by implementing new algorithms;
provide collections of mathematical data; or provide enhanced tools for 
package developers. Packages can be published independently of the core \GAP
system and have a separate authorship. Package authors are recommended to 
use a similar approach to testing and to provide their own regression tests.
For packages redistributed with \GAP, our automatic package update system
checks regularly for new versions on the authors web pages, retrieves them, and then uses them in a
number of checks to ensure that new package releases are compatible with
each other and do not break the functionality of the core \GAP system. The
same process also helps us to check that changes in the core \GAP system
do not break the functionality of the packages redistributed with \GAP
%% (provided those packages have standard tests that allow us to do that
%% automatically)
. This system has dramatically simplified the process of making a \GAP
release or update, for which we want a mutually compatible set of
package versions, also compatible with the new core system. This used
to require extensive negotiation with package authors, and sometimes
took months, even though the number of packages was much smaller. Now
developers have continuous visibility of the functionality and
compatibility of released and upcoming versions of packages and of the
core system, and releases are much faster.

\comment{Tenses in the next para are confused. This is all past, I
  think, and is also maybe a bit too much about stuff that happened
  before the project, before we get to anything new. Can we start by
  saying what new developments we are claiming, and then go back and
  explain what didn't work before?}
\comment{Also maybe a subheading of some kind here}
\GAP has used regression tests in one or another form since the
release of version 3 in the 1980s. For much of this time, they were
run by developers manually, and a part of the
release preparation was sending an email to the \GAP developers mailing
list asking for help with running a set of tests on developers' 
computers. Since 2009, the \GAP team in St Andrews started to use the Jenkins
(\url{https://jenkins.io/}) automation sysetem to regularly run the 
GAP testsuite, and eventually established a set of nightly and weekly
running Jenkins jobs to run tests for the current \GAP development
version; check for package updates; prepare and test release candidates,
and other tasks. The system can keep and archive of test logs, and notify
developers when tests fail; however, the biggest limitations are that
it is not public and can be accessed only within St Andrews, and that 
it runs tests for changes that are \emph{already} in the development
version of \GAP, instead of checking them in advance. We understood
that one of the limiting factors (not only for the testing, but for
the \GAP development in general is that while \GAP is an open source 
software, it does not follow an open development model and does not
have a public source code repository. 


%See https://blogs.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/alexk/2016/03/07/gap-on-github-one-year-on/
Of course, \GAP is not new to version control, and the former
CVS repository for \GAP 4 has revisions from 1996. In summer 2012 it
had been converted to Mercurial (thanks to Max Horn) after the release 
of \GAP 4.5, and then in February 2015 the Mercurial repository had 
been converted to Git (thanks to Chris Jefferson) and placed on GitHub
at \url{https://github.com/gap-system/gap}.

\comment{So the move to GitHub was just before the start of the
  project. So I guess our claim in this report is that we have
  consolidated \GAP development around GitHub and its tool ecosystem
  (maybe mention that we can break out onto GitLab if GitHub goes
  phut). I'd start with that.}
  
Hosting GAP repository on GitHub and eventual establishing of a number
of other repositories under the gap-system and gap-packages 
organisations (\url{https://github.com/gap-system} and 
\url{https://github.com/gap-packages}), and encouraging package authors 
to follow the same practices (see \url{https://gap-packages.github.io/})
to find some further packages that are having public source code 
repositories elsewhere) allowed us to bring our regression testing
up to the next level.

We made use of \href{https://travis-ci.org/}{Travis CI} and
\ref{https://www.appveyor.com/}{AppVeyor} which are 
free (for open source projects) continuous integration platforms 
that can be used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub.
\emph{Continuous Integration}, usually abbreviated as {\bf CI} is the process
automated building and testing for every performed or suggested changes to 
the source code repository. Using Travis and AppVeyor, one can test changes proposed
in a pull request \emph{before} they are merged into the main repository.
At the moment, we use Travis CI for tests on Linux and macOS, and 
AppVeyor for tests on Windows.

In addition to that, we started to use \href{https://codecov.io/}{Codecov}
platform to collect \emph{code coverage} reports for GAP to ensure that our
regression tests exercise GAP codebase at an acceptable level, and then
the changes which are submitted via pull request are actually being tested
by Travis CI. Making these results easily obtainable and publicly available
had a great effect on the community. Adding new tests to improve code coverage
is a useful task for new contributors to familiarise themselves with the
project setup. Making coverage reports available for each pull requests
facilitates checking code coverage during code review and
encourages their authors to ensure that their contributions have a good
quality and their suggested changes are actually being tested. \TODO{Can we back this claim up with numbers? One can explore code coverage for merged pull requests at
\url{https://codecov.io/gh/gap-system/gap/pulls}, we could add a
screenshot to illustrate it. Reliable numbers are harder by a number of reasons.}

A crucial role in these developments was played by the enhanced
profiling facilities discussed 
in Subsection~\label{gap-4.8}. 
GAP~4.8 also introduced the {\tt TestDirectory} function to find
(recursively) all {\tt .tst} files from a given directory or a list of 
directories and run them using {\tt Test}. Having ability to test
changes more efficiently also allowed us to further improve all 
tools involved in testing, making their output more informative,
and allowing test integration into various automated workflows
by a better detection of the test outcomes. % the logic seems backwards here. Better test tools let us test better, not v.v.
% What I had in mind was that once we set up the system with the
% state of the testing framework as it was, we were able to "test the testing"
% itself, and improve it - for example, by adding progress indicators,
% report time spent on GC and memory used, etc.

Figure~\ref{fig:gap-core-tests} displays a part of the dashboard
available at \url{https://github.com/gap-system/gap-distribution/}.
The ``status'' buttons lead to the test reports on Travis CI, and
the ``code coverage'' buttons lead to the code coverage reports on
Codecov. The coverage is shown for the latest revision in the
corresponding branch (release branches {\tt stable-4.9} and {\tt stable-4.10},
and the master branch which is the prototype of the coming GAP~4.11 release).

The top part of Figure~\ref{fig:gap-core-tests} shows core system GAP tests,
which are run for every change made to the repository. The bottom part shows
tests which are run once in 24 hours using a Docker container which is built
using a snapshot of the GAP development version on the moment of its creation
and a selection of \GAP packages (including their updates, not yet redistributed
with \GAP). Clicking on the ``status'' button will lead to the overview displayed
on Figure~\ref{fig:gap-docker-master-testsuite}, from where one could inspect
test logs for each of the configurations and see the diagnostics in case of a
test failure.

    \label{fig:gap-docker-master-testsuite}
\end{figure}

The Docker container for the test displayed on Figure~\ref{fig:gap-docker-master-testsuite}
is one of a set of containers that we maintain for various purposes, from offering 
them as alternative distributions (see Subsection~\ref{distro}) or components for shareable
reproducible experiments (see Section~\ref{demos}), to ways to speed up regression tests running
container-based tests on Travis CI. These containers are publicly available on Docker Hub
(see Figure~\ref{fig:gap-docker}).

At the same time, we continue to use Jenkins installation in St Andrews 
for daily and weekly tests, running package updates system, wrapping and
testing release candidates and other tasks. It is also very valuable since 
it does not impose time limits on output inactivity and the overall duration
of the job; second, it allows us to log in into the test workspace for
debugging; third, with the specific \GAP setup for Windows we build it on a
machine with a Cygwin installation, and then install it on a clean Windows
machine to test there. 

\section{\GAP Packages}\label{packages}

Developments, described in the previous section, together with community
supporting activities described in Section~\ref{gap-support}, had substantial
impact on on the health of the package ecosystem. In the duration of the OpenDreamKit
project, we have observed the growth of the number of \GAP packages and package 
authors, improvements in the quality of package testing, more frequent
package updates, and a wide range of tools to help package authors progressed
to a mature state and gained popularity.

First we will introduce these tools, and then we will discuss an impact which
they, together with encouraging package authors to use the open development
model, had on the package authors community.

Our collaborator Max Horn (University of Siegen) developed {\sf ReleaseTools}
(\url{https://github.com/gap-system/ReleaseTools/})
-- a set of scripts to help package authors with the process of making new 
releases. This tool automates all steps of publishing a release for a \GAP package
hosted on GitHub. Without such a tool, making a release involves a lot of steps
and it is quite easy to overlook some of them if one only makes a release from 
time to time; the correction may require even more work. Using {\sf ReleaseTools},
a release may be published in a several minutes with a single call of the release
script, and package authors do not have an obstacle preventing them from publishing
releases more often.

{\sf ReleaseTools} works in conjunction with {\sf GitHubPagesForGAP}
(\url{https://github.com/gap-system/GitHubPagesForGAP}). Using the
latter, one can quickly set up a website for a \GAP package which has
a GitHub repository. This website will be hosted on GitHub pages,
and will be updated each time when the author uses {\sf ReleaseTools}
to publish a new release. All information on the package
website will be automatically updated from the metadata provided by
the package. This greatly simplifies the procedure and helps to keep 
the package website up-to-date.

The \GAP package {\sf Example} by Werner Nickel, Greg Gamble and
Alexander Konovalov (\url{https://github.com/gap-packages/example}
is an example of a \GAP package which may be used as a template for 
a new package. During the reported period, it has been regularly updated
to keep up with the updates of the packages infrastructure. It
switched to using {\tt TestDirectory} to demonstrate how to use 
multiple test files in a GAP package, and migrated
to GitHub, using {\sf ReleaseTools/GitHubPagesForGAP}
for new releases. The guidance for package authors, formerly offered
as an appendix to the {\sf Example} package manual, was moved to the GAP
Reference manual in \GAP~4.9 release. Finally, the {\sf Example} package
demonstrates how to set up Travis CI and CodeCov. Package authors
may copy its configuration files and adapt them with minimal changes.

As an alternative, to create a new package
\GAP users may use another tool called {\sf PackageMaker},
also by Max Horn (\url{https://github.com/gap-system/PackageMaker}). This is
a \GAP package (not redistributed with \GAP, so one should install it
separately), which provides a ``PackageWizard'' - a tool which asks questions
about the intended package, and then creates a new directory populated with 
all the files needed for the start.

\GAP packages should provide documentation. It is possible to use several
formats, one of them is obsolete, originating from the deprecated 
manual format used by GAP in the past, but still in use by 32 packages.
% https://github.com/gap-system/gap-distribution/issues/49
A newer one is an XML-based format which is used for the main \GAP manuals
and requires {\sf GAPDoc package} to build the documentation. Writing XML
code by hand is very tedious and error-prone, and in 2012 Sebastian Gutsche 
and Max Horn (presently both at the University of Siegen) started an 
{\sf AutoDoc} package (\url{https://gap-packages.github.io/AutoDoc/}).
This package allows to create documentation from source code comments
without writing XML files, and then automatically generates XML input
for GAPDoc. By now, this package became very flexible and reliable, and
has been picked up by a number \comment{how many} of GAP packages for building 
some parts or their whole manuals.

The Docker containers for the latest \GAP public release and for the
development branches of the \GAP repository on GitHub, described in
Section~\ref{gap-infra}, enabled us to make results of regression
tests for \GAP packages easily available to their authors. First,
using a prebuilt docker image does not require to compile GAP and 
packages for each separate test configuration. Therefore, we may
have a separate test configuration for each package. Second, we 
can make test results available to package authors on the Travis CI
website, and ease navigation due to one configuration per package,
so the authors can navigate to the package of their interest.
Finally, we put packages with passing and failing tests into different
Travis jobs, and use that to monitor their status and check that
changes in GAP do not break package tests. 

Figure~\ref{fig:gap-docker-pkg-tests} shows a fragment of the dashboard
from \url{https://github.com/gap-system/gap-distribution} which 
indicates tests status. In this situation, it happened that a fresh
change in the master branch broke tests in one of the packages;
\comment{In fact, in this particular case changes in \GAP were made that 
an empty list no longer qualifies as legal input to {\tt IsDiagonalMat},
but that was used in the {\sf Cryst} package}
the author was immediately notified and reacted with a quick fix.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/gap-docker-pkg-tests}
    \caption{Dashboard for Travis tests of \GAP packages (GitHub view)}
    \label{fig:gap-docker-pkg-tests}
\end{figure}

The setup for such tests is organised in the gap-infra GitHub organisation
(\url{https://github.com/gap-infra}. Figure~\ref{fig:gap-infra-travis} shows a 
screenshot of a dashboard which indicates tests status.
\comment{All these screenshots may be superfluous - I made them to show
what could be included, we can remove some or cut parts of them out later}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/gap-infra-travis}
    \caption{Dashboard for Travis tests of \GAP packages (Travis CI view)}
    \label{fig:gap-infra-travis}
\end{figure}

One of the extensions of the package testing framework, greatly 
facilitated by packages migrating to GitHub, was adding tests not
only for the latest official releases of GAP packages, but also
for their \emph{development} versions.
% https://travis-ci.org/gap-infra/gap-docker-pkg-tests-stable-4.10-devel
% https://travis-ci.org/gap-infra/gap-docker-pkg-tests-master-devel
In this case, the onus to check tests outcomes is on package authors,
and they are able to see how the changes that they have made to
a package but not released yet work in different settings (stable/master,
with default/without/with all packages).

Figure~\ref{fig:gap-packages-travis} shows a screenshot of a 
report on the activity in the gap-packages organisation 
for the last month (for the current version of 
this report, check \url{https://travis-ci.org/gap-packages?tab=insights}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/gap-packages-travis}
    \caption{Activity of Travis tests in gap-packages GitHub organisation}
    \label{fig:gap-packages-travis}
\end{figure}

Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:gap-packages-codecov} show the code coverage
leaderboard. We aim at ensuring that code coverage for packages is 
not worse than for the core GAP system, but packages presented there 
put a lot of efforts in ensuring that their coverage is close to 100\%. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/gap-packages-codecov}
    \caption{Codecov leaderboard for in gap-packages GitHub organisation}
    \label{fig:gap-packages-codecov}
\end{figure}

Presently, only 4 packages redistributed with GAP do not have a public 
source code repository. To compare, in October 2018 there were 23 such 
packages. In some cases, that involved non-trivial efforts to establish 
contacts with authors who left academia, getting their permission and 
establishing package license, populating a new repository with releases 
history using archives of past releases, and adopting the packages to
be collectively maintained by the GAP Group. This helps to preserve the
code, reproduce past experiments, eventually find those who may be interested
to take it over.

Figure~\ref{fig:gap-package-releases} shows the number of \GAP packages
included in some \GAP release and their distribution by the year of their
release. At the beginning of the project, GAP 4.7.9 published in November
2015 included 119 packages, 52\% of which were released in 2014--2015.
Now, GAP 4.10.2 included 145 packages, 88\% of which were released in
2018--2019. The ``long tail'' of packages that haven't been updated for
a long time is gradually reducing (we take measures of not breaking
existing functionality, but old packages are usually not picking up
new improvements; and may prevent us from withdrawing obsolete
functionality). Larger proportion of recent releases means that 
packages are updated to make use of the recent \GAP developments,
they are responsive to reports about detected problems; hosting packages on GitHub
facilitates that; we can help by submitting PRs and publish releases for authors,
who prefer to overlook mathematical functionality and general development of the
package but do not want to dive into technicalities of release wrapping.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/gap-package-releases}
    \caption{Number of \GAP packages and their release year}
    \label{fig:gap-package-releases}
\end{figure}

Moving to GitHub made it easier to start a new package, and to 
get new contributors to existing packages. As Figure~\ref{fig:gap-package-tests}
shows, the number of packages authors increased from 158 in
November 4.7.9 to 196 in June 2019. 

Over the same time, not only package releases became more frequent, but also their quality
improved. If in November 52\% of packages did not provide a standard 
test at all, presently 78\% of packages do have a standard test 
% https://github.com/gap-packages/gap-packages.github.io/issues/9
so their authors are responsible for regular testing them 
with GAP releases and development versions.
Some of them use their own setup for continuous integration
(like e.g. the {\sf homalg} project, using \href{https://circleci.com/}{CircleCI}).

At the moment of writing, in the stable-4.10 branch,
standard tests pass for 102 packages
% https://travis-ci.org/gap-infra/gap-docker-pkg-tests-stable-4.10
and fail for 12.
% https://travis-ci.org/gap-infra/gap-docker-pkg-tests-stable-4.10-staging 
(it may be worth to note what "fail" means - not serious bugs
but different output, or incompatibility with some other package
not loaded by default).

We aim at making a minor release every several months and a major 
release once or twice per year. 

Actual schedule may be corrected - critical bug fixes may need 
an urgent minor release, and substantial changes may require 
more time for a major release.

Usually, if a previous minor release has been made a couple of 
months ago, and there is a substantial amount (say, 15 or more) 
of updated packages and/or changes in the core \GAP system, 
there may be a time for a release.

Figure~\ref{fig:gap-package-releases} shows the number of minor
and major \GAP releases per year, starting from the release of
\GAP~4.4 in 2004.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering

\end{figure}

Release wrapping and automated testing is performed in St Andrews
using the Jenkins automation system. \GAP distribution is tested
in various combinations of operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
and build modes (32-bit and 64-bit), and with different sets of
loaded packages. Automated regular testing of the codebase ensures
that we can release as often as deemed necessary. Modern version
control system helps us to have release branches and a master branch
where we accumulate things for the next major release, and then
create the next release branch for things to stabilise and let package
authors to test it and if need be adapt their packages.

\GAP distribution is provided in several archive formats for Linux and macOS,
and in zip archives and as an executable installer for Windows.
We also provide several auxiliary archives which keep the core system
and packages separately - these are used by providers of alternative
distributions, systems which use \GAP (such as SageMath and OSCAR)
and for testing.

\GAP alternative distributions include the Docker container for the 
latest public \GAP release (\url{https://hub.docker.com/r/gapsystem/gap-docker/},
and a so called ``tap'' for the Homebrew package manager for macOS
(\url{https://github.com/gap-system/homebrew-gap}). 

It is also possible to try \GAP online in a Jupyter notebook running 
on Binder, following instructions from the README file in the repository
located at \url{https://github.com/gap-system/try-gap-in-jupyter}.

One could also use \GAP via a free or paid account
on \href{https://cocalc.com/}{CoCalc} (formerly SageMathCloud).
The user should be aware that the combination of \GAP packages 
available there may differ from the one from the official \GAP distribution.

\section{Jupyter interface to \GAP}

TODO: Refer to previous deliverables and describe how their outputs
evolved and any impacts they achieved

JupyterKernel has been reported in DX.Y. Since that, there were
several more releases of the kernel, associated with new \GAP
releases, improving its robustness. 

JupyterKernel lead to several follow-up developments, their
functionality will be described below: Francy, JupyterViz,
other work by Nathan Carter (also mention related work on
GroupExplorer).

Have used in in teaching and in explaining how to share 
reproducible experiments that use \GAP. Using Binder
allows to try \GAP in Jupyter online. Provide details
and consider including an appendix with an example 
demonstrating the setup.

\section{Sharing reproducible computational experiments}

This appendix presents an example of organising GAP code 
and data to give others an opportunity to inspect them and rerun
the computation on a freely available called \href{https://mybinder.org/}{Binder}.

It demonstrates integration of a number of concepts mentioned
in the report: GAP regression testing; setup for continuous
integration and code coverage reports; Docker containers with
the GAP distribution; and GAP Jupyter interface.

For this demonstrator, we collaborated with the authors of \cite{black-box} 
who worked on the code for this paper in the GitHub repository located 
at \url{https://github.com/sukru-yalcinkaya/unipoly} in the file 
called {\tt unipoly.g}.

This code does not justify the creation of a new GAP package, 
but it can reuse packages setup for Travis CI and Codecov by 
creating a {\tt tst} directory with the test files and adapting
{\tt .travis.yml} and {\tt .codecov.yml} configuration files
from the \GAP package {\sf Example}. Importantly, it also
allows to check that the code works in GAP 4.9, GAP 4.10 and 
the master branch of the GAP repository, which is a prototype for
GAP 4.11.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/unipoly-repo}
    \caption{unipoly project repository}
    \label{fig:unipoly-repo}
\end{figure}

The next step is to produce a Jupyter notebook which combines input,
output, and textual narrative in one document. The notebook contains
the {\tt Read(unipoly.g);} command to read the code first. This is
a good practice for organising reproducible experiments: keeping the
code in a single location in a {\tt .g} file allows its reuse and
automated testing, and avoids code duplication. 

When the authors prepared and committed the Jupyter notebook describing
their calculation, they are ready to share it on
\href{https://mybinder.org/}{Binder}. First they need to add 
to their repository a {\tt Dockefile} with the following content:

{\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
FROM gapsystem/gap-docker

MAINTAINER Alexander Konovalov <alexander.konovalov@st-andrews.ac.uk>

COPY --chown=1000:1000 . $HOME/unipoly

RUN sudo pip3 install ipywidgets RISE

RUN jupyter-nbextension install rise --user --py

RUN jupyter-nbextension enable rise --user --py

USER gap

WORKDIR $HOME/unipoly
\end{verbatim}
}

This file builds a Docker container based on the container {\tt gapsystem/gap-docker}
with the latest GAP release, which we provide as an alternative GAP distribution
(see Subsection~\ref{distro}). Additional commands specify how to copy the code into
the new container, and install additional extensions for Jupyter-based slideshows.

After that one should follow \href{https://mybinder.org/}{Binder} instructions to
set up a new Binder project. A completed setup will allow to click on the ``launch binder''
button in the README file on GitHub (as seen on Figure~\ref{fig:unipoly-repo}
to start a Jupyter notebook server in the cloud,
either using a prebuilt image of the project or by building a new one in case of any
changes in the GitHub repository. When the server will be started, it will display
a file browser as shown on Figure~\ref{fig:unipoly-files}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/unipoly-files}
    \caption{File browser running on Binder}
    \label{fig:unipoly-files}
\end{figure}

Clicking on {\tt unipoly.ipynb}, the user will open the Jupyter notebook
and will be able to rerun it as shown on Figure~\ref{fig:unipoly-notebook}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/unipoly-notebook}
    \caption{Jupyter notebook running on Binder}
    \label{fig:unipoly-notebook}
\end{figure}

One could also switch to the slideshow mode (the notebook would require
some configuration to explain which cells should be displayed on the
same slide and which not), and run an interactive presentation, as
as shown on Figure~\ref{fig:unipoly-slide}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/unipoly-slide}
    \caption{Slideshow with interactive computation running on Binder}
    \label{fig:unipoly-slide}
\end{figure}

Thus, connecting the project repository to Binder allows other users
(e.g. readers or referees of the paper) to rerun computations on Binder
without spending efforts on installing all necessary components
(may be hard for them as non experts, may not always be possible;
something may not work on Windows, etc.
