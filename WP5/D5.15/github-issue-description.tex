\href{https://www.gap-system.org/}{GAP ("Groups, Algorithms,
Programming'')} is a software system for computational discrete
mathematics, with its origins in finite group theory. The system has
been developed continually since 1986, with the first public release in
1988. Throughout its life it has been made available free of charge for
use, extension and non-commercial redistribution. It is widely used by
researchers in mathematics, computer science and other disciplines, and
has been cited in
\href{https://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Bib/bib.html}{more than 3000
research publications}. It is also widely
\href{https://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Teaching/teaching.html}{used in
teaching}. GAP is also used as a component of other mathematical
software systems such as \href{http://www.sagemath.org/}{SageMath} and
\href{https://oscar.computeralgebra.de}{OSCAR}.

This report describes the work undertaken in connection with
\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/100}{Task
5.2}: a wide range of developments within the GAP system to meet the
general objective of
\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/labels/WP5}{workpackage
5} ("improve the performance of the computational components of
OpenDreamKit"). We have worked on supporting the use of a range of High
Performance Computing environments, prioritizing those most accessible
to our users, namely multi-core systems, adding to our existing support
for clusters and cloud computing. We have also made fundamental
performance improvements and improvements to our tools, processes and to
the programming language, that benefit all GAP users.

A collection of GAP Jupyter notebooks, together with the setup to
execute them on \href{https://mybinder.org/}{Binder}, is available at
\url{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/gap-demos}.
