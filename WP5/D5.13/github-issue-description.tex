\section*{Context}\label{context}

Singular is a computer algebra system aimed at computations in algebraic
geometry and is one of the components used by Sage for computations with
multivariate polynomials. The multivariate arithmetic currently in
Singular is in need of improvement. Speeding up arithmetic operations in
Singular will provide benefits to users of both Singular and Sage.

\section*{Goal of the deliverable}\label{goal-of-the-deliverable}

The aim of this deliverable is to modernize the sparse multivariate
arithmetic in Singular by 1) updating the algorithms to the state of the
art and by 2) applying thread level parallelism to achieve decent
scaling on multi-core machines. The operations we focus on are
multiplication, divisibility testing, and the computation of the
greatest common divisor.
