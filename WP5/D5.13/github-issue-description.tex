Singular is a computer algebra system aimed at computations in algebraic
geometry and is one of the key components used by SageMath. Computing
with multivariate polynomials being at the core of Singular, their
performance impacts the whole system.

The aim of this deliverable was to modernize Singular's sparse
multivariate arithmetic by 1) updating the algorithms to the state of
the art and by 2) applying thread level parallelism to achieve decent
scaling on multi-core machines. The operations we focused on are
multiplication, divisibility testing, and the computation of the
greatest common divisor. The implementation was carried out in the C
library Flint, which is used by Singular but also by independent
systems. The latter thus also benefit from the improvements. Among many
other applications, this tackles the long standing slowness of
multivariate rational fractions in SageMath.
