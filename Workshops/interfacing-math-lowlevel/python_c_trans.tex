\subsubsection{Cython}

Python compiler

\subsubsection{Numba}

JIT Python compiler tailored for fast numerical code (number crunching, Numpy arrays, ...).
It runs on CPython and can compile to CPU (x86, x86-64) / GPU (NVidia). It's backed by llvm, and benefits from its optimizations. It takes as input a Python function (typically through a decorator), and works from its AST:

TODO: example

\subsubsection{Pythran}

Static compiler for numerical code (similar to numba), with a focus on high level code (vectorized, numpy style).
Type annotation for functions can (must?) be provided in comments above.

Dependencies: a C++11 compliant compiler, numpy, networkx

Choices and consequences: Take from Serge's talk
