----------- Overall evaluation -----------
The paper presents an integration of Jupyter (for computation in notebooks) with MathHub (for interactive math documents) and with MMT (for describing semantics), into a single system, and evaluates that integration through several interesting case studies. It is quite apparent that the integration involved much thought and considerable software/infrastructure development, and had to address significant challenges that any integrator faces, especially when integrating very disparate systems/paradigms, as is the case in this paper. 

The paper described briefly some of those challenges. The presentation, however, seems more suitable for a paper in the Systems track than a paper that describes scholarly work. It is advisable to include, even if briefly, the scholarly challenges that were faced and the technical methods used to meet them. 
Still, the technical work that went into this big integration, and the highly valuable contribution that the resulting system makes to the community, render the paper rather worthy.

Here are a couple of minor edits:
- Page 1, rth line from the bottom: "a integration" should be "an integration"
- Page 9, subsection 3.1, item 4: delete one occurrence of "new" in "new new"
- Page 10, 2nd line after Fig. 4: "it's" should be "its"

This paper seems like an extremely interesting, well-written,
contribution and therefore I recommend accept.

I did have some minor editorial comments though.


Specific comments
-----------------

p.1, Abstract, paragraph 2. Why put such a short 2-sentence paragraph
here. It should be merged with one of the other paragraphs.
p.1, Abstract, pararaph 3, line 2. "MMT, which" -> "MMT which"
p.1, line -4. "a integration" -> "an integration"
p.2, line 9. "python" -> "Python"
p.2, line 16. "language in" -> "language. In"

p.3, Section 2.1, line 3. "symbols, whose" -> "symbols whose"
p.5, line -6. "in other frontends than" -> "in frontends other than"
p.5, lines -4-(-3). Merge this 1-sentence paragraph with the next one.

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
The paper presents a Jupyter kernel for MMT and integrates the resulting notebooks into MathHub, which is a web portal for mathematical documents. In practice, this makes MMT available in Jupyter and means Jupyter widgets such as data visualisation available for MMT. The challenges here are largely in integrating the different systems and different representations of data and knowledge.

I think this is a valuable contribution. and the paper is nicely written and well presented. The MMT kernel is a welcome addition to the Jupyter ecosystem. One interesting distinction is that MMT performs manipulation of symbolic expressions as well as computation. Perhaps it would be useful early on in the paper to illustrate how this is distinct from typical engines in Jupyter, and especially to show the new things it enables. It might also be useful to say a little more about MMT's goals (even if this won't be new to quite a few of the CICM audience, I still think it might help make the paper's motivation and contributions clearer).

A significant part of the paper is in describing the technical detials of linking MMT to Jupyter - this is fine, and I wonder if there are things that authors of other similar systems (especially, systems which involve manipulating symblic expressions such as interactive theorem provers) may be able to learn from your experience.

Section 4 describes the immediate goal of the work, and as this gives a fairly concrete motivation for it, I would suggest bringing at least some of this to the introduction.

Overall, I think this is a nicely presented paper describing an interesting tool and I suggest it be accepted.
