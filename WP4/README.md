# WP4: User Interfaces

Lead Institution: Simula Research Laboratory

- Objectives:

The objective of this work package is to provide modern, robust, and flexible user interfaces for computation, supporting
real-time sharing, integration with collaborative problem-solving, multilingual documents, paper writing and publication,
links to databases, etc.

- Description:

Project JUPYTER (formerly IPYTHON notebook) provides a browser based approach to constructing executable documents
which comprise of code (in multiple languages), mathematics, text, and diagrams (see Section 1.3.4). The
framework is an ideal portal through which VRE can be operated. In this work package, we will add new functionality
to the JUPYTER notebook that fosters excellence in computational science and research. In particular, we will push
towards reproducible and effective science by allowing structured documents (such as reports, books, theses) from notebooks,
and by allowing those notebooks to be re-executed as self-contained regression tests. We will unify the notebook
infrastructure used in SAGE with JUPYTER, push forward dynamic documentation exploration capabilities, and work towards
concurrent multi-user editing of notebooks. We will also develop exemplar JUPYTER notebooks for education and
research (e.g. T2.9).
To demonstrate the power of the OpenDreamKit environment to accelerate computational science, deliver better
value for money and make computational science more robust, we will put together a micromagnetic VRE (1.3.7) as a
demonstrator.
