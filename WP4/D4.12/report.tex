\section{Introduction}

The \href{https://jupyter.org}{Jupyter Notebook} is a web application
that enables the creation and sharing of executable documents
containing live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.
In particular, Jupyter is used actively for interactive and exploratory computations,
often involving visualization of data.

Because Jupyter is a web-based application,
it can benefit from developments in the wider community development of visualization tools for the web, in which there is a lot of activity.
The primary task for developing visualization tools in Jupyter is providing tools for connecting
"kernel" code, where the user's code runs,
to visualization code running in the browser.
Two-dimensional visualization in Jupyter is an area with popular and well-established tools
such as \href{https://matplotlib.org}{matplotlib}, \href{https://bokeh.pydata.org/}{bokeh}, and \href{https://altair-viz.github.io}{altair},
but there have been fewer mature solutions for three-dimensional visualization in Jupyter.
It is an area of active exploration,
so we first set out to identify the current state of the art for 3D visualization in Jupyter,
and determine where our efforts could best be placed.
We did this in the form of a report on the landscape of 3D visualization in Jupyter in 2017.

The Jupyter ecosystem includes a collection of projects called `Jupyter Widgets,'
which is a widely used system for providing bidirectional communcation
between the kernel and the browser.
The widgets provide a powerful and extensible system and we chose to use it as our basis for development of new visualization tools,
and focused our efforts with existing tools on improving compatibility with the Jupyter Widgets system.

For this deliverable, we aim to accomplish two main tasks: To better
understand the existing landscape of community efforts for three-dimensional
visualization in notebooks and to contribute where we may have the best
impact, whether it be in contributing to existing projects or creating new
tools. We have accomplished both. In particular, we have helped improve the
core Jupyter Widgets framework and the JupyterLab application, and we have
developed new software in the K3D, ipyscales, ipydatawidgets, and others.

\section{Impact}

We have developed several new software packages and contributed to the core Jupyter widget frameworks used by hundreds of thousands of people.

\subsection{Report on the landscape of 3D visualization}\label{landscape}

To identify where to most effectively put our efforts,
we examined the landscape of existing 3D visualization projects,
included in appendix \ref{landscape}.
We observed several existing projects with various levels of maturity and activity, and different strengths and weaknesses.
The primary conclusions of the report were that 1. \href{https://threejs.org}{three.js} is a good candidate as a common ground on which 3D visualization tools could be built because it is an active project and already in use by several tools, and 2. the Jupyter Widgets provide a good system for implementing communication between the Jupyter kernel and the browser.
This report helped us spend our efforts most effectively,
but is a useful guide in its own right for observing the state of

\subsubsection{K3D-jupyter}

K3D-jupyter is a package which provides the fast and simple 3d
plotting tool in the Jupyter notebook. The primary aim of K3D is to be
easy for use as stand alone package like matplotlib, but also to
allow interoperation with existing libraries as VTK. The power of
ipywidgets makes it also a fast and performant visualisation tool for
HPC computing e.g. fluid dynamics.


\subsection{Lattice-Boltzmann visualisation}

The Lattice Boltzmann method has recently became a very popular method
in computational fluid mechanics. The most popular variant is based on
regular grids which makes it very efficient on GPU architectures. This
makes in turn very important to have web based visualisation tool, as
it is very common to run the simulation on the remove GPU server using
jupyter notebook interface.

We have equipped K3D-jupyter package in few features which make the
visualisation of boundary condidtions and fields in computational
fluid dynamics especially easy:

\begin{itemize}
\item We have added a native method for displaying voxel geometry,
  which performance and quality is appropriate for typical geometries
  in LBM.
\item There are available standart functions for plotting vectors and lines.
\item There exists specialized method for displaying crosss section of
  a computational domain, optimized for real time update during the
  simulation (K3D.texture).
\item Volume rendering is supported, which is very powerfull tool in
  visualization of scalar fields.
\item K3D objects can be dynamically updated during the simulation.
\end{itemize}

Additionally K3D-jupyter can be easily used in a VTK pipeline and
therefore it can display various sophisticated visualisation
methods. It also extends most of its CFD capabilities beyond regular
grid based the LBM simulations and make it viable tool for any CFD
package.

An important aspect of K3D development was to provide a tool for
displaying live LBM simulation without any performance penalty. The
classical approach was usually to store all fields to files for
postprocessing done usually in software like paraview. Live inspection
of data during a simualtion was very limited.  If one takes, a typical
simulation taking place on GPU, then it is not uncommon to have it
running with 1 GLUPS (giga lattice updates per second) on modern
hardware. It means that the full velocity field in each time iteration
would need bandwidth c.a. 12 GB/s. Those numbers are many orders of
magnitude higher than capabilities of web connection.  The reasonable
solution is to perform some visualisation on GPU and send a reduced
dataset to the web-browser. We have experimented with two such
methods: a slice of the data and tracer particles. In sailfish-cfd we
have implemented a method which can on request do a 2d slice through
the computational domain. The slice is done in GPU memory and at not
point the whole dataset is transfered to the host. Then we fetch the
slice and display the data using k3d.texture function. In this way it
is possible to monitor a running simulation with very high refresh
rate inside the Jupyter notebook.

The implementation of this work took the form of contributions to shared-infrastructure projects in the Jupyter ecosystem, as well as several new software packages.

The package K3D-jupyter is based on theejs as a front-end 3d library
and ipywidgets (see fig. \ref{fig:pdep}) for communication.  There exists also
experimental support for ipydatawidgets.
