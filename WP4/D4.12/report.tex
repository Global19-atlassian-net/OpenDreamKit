\section{Introduction}

The \href{https://jupyter.org}{Jupyter Notebook} is a web application
that enables the creation and sharing of executable documents
containing live code, equations, visualisations and explanatory text.
In particular, Jupyter is used actively for interactive and exploratory computations,
often involving visualisation of data.

Two-dimensional visualisation in Jupyter is an area with popular and well-established tools
such as \href{https://matplotlib.org}{matplotlib}, \href{https://bokeh.pydata.org/}{bokeh}, and \href{https://altair-viz.github.io}{altair},
but there have been fewer mature solutions for interactive three-dimensional visualisation.
It is an area of active exploration,
so we first set out to identify the current state of the art,
and determine where our efforts could best be placed.
We did this in the form of a report on the landscape of 3D
visualisation in Jupyter in 2017, see Appendix \ref{landscape}.

Because Jupyter is a web-based application, it can benefit from the
very active development, in the wider community, of browser-based
interactive visualisation tools. Therefore, the primary task when
developing visualisation tools for Jupyter is to connect `kernel'
code, where the user's code runs, to visualisation code running in the
browser. This is a standard need and the Jupyter ecosystem provides a
powerful and extensible system for bidirectional communication between
the kernel and the browser, which serves as foundation for a wide
collection of interactive tools and projects for Jupyter called
`Jupyter Widgets'.

We therefore naturally chose this foundation and focused our efforts
on improving compatibility between existing browser-based tools and
the Jupyter Widgets system.

The aim of this deliverable was twofold: to better
understand the existing landscape of community efforts for three-dimensional
visualisation in notebooks; and to contribute where we may have the best
impact, whether it be in contributing to existing projects or creating new
tools. We have accomplished both. In particular, we have helped improve the
core Jupyter Widgets framework and the JupyterLab application, and we have
developed new software in
\href{https://github.com/K3D-tools/K3D-jupyter}{K3D-jupyter},
\href{https://demo.logilab.fr/SciviJS/}{SciviJS},
\href{https://github.com/vidartf/ipyscales}{ipyscales},
\href{https://github.com/vidartf/ipydatawidgets}{ipydatawidgets},
\href{https://github.com/vidartf/unray}{unray},
and others projects.

\TODO{verify PMs with Logilab and Silesia}

Overall, \ODK contributed approximately 18 person-months to improving existing software in the community and delivering new software.

\section{Outcomes}

We have developed several new software packages and contributed to the core Jupyter widget frameworks used by hundreds of thousands of people.

\subsection{Report on the landscape of 3D visualisation}\label{landscape}

To identify where to most effectively put our efforts,
we examined the landscape of existing 3D visualisation projects,
included in appendix \ref{landscape}.
We observed several existing projects with various levels of maturity and activity, and different strengths and weaknesses.
The primary conclusions of the report were that 1. \href{https://threejs.org}{three.js} is a good candidate as a common ground on which 3D visualisation tools could be built because it is an active project and already in use by several tools, and 2. the Jupyter Widgets provide a good system for implementing communication between the Jupyter kernel and the browser.
This report helped us spend our efforts most effectively,
but is a useful guide in its own right for observing the state
of 3D visualisation in Jupyter.


\subsection{Improving core Jupyter tools and infrastructure for visualisation}\label{improving-core}

There are a number of common aspects of 3D visualisation,
which can be shared across 3D visualisation and other tools
in the notebook.
In order to maximize the impact of our work,
we aimed to improve this infrastructure,
both by contributing to existing packages and creating some new ones
that should be broadly useful.

Given the identification of three.js as a common denominator among visualisation tools
we decided to pick up and finalize an existing effort to rewrite the package
\emph{pythreejs}. The package allows for full 3D scene creation and management from the
kernel. By rewriting the package to use auto-generation of code, a much larger
part of the three.js API could be exposed to the kernel side, greatly extending
its capabilities, and reducing the future maintenance burden. We also incorporated
functionality into pythreejs to allow it serve as an extension
point for other extensions, thereby being capable of serving as an interoperability
platform between different libraries as well.
\ODK members completed this effort and led the process of making a 1.0 release of the pythreejs package,
and are now serving as a maintainer of the pythreejs package.

One of the challenges with 3D visualisation in the browser of data originating from
a possibly remote kernel is the efficient transfer of data between the two. To help
solve this problem, the library \emph{ipydatawidgets} was created by \ODK. It incorporates
best practices for the binary transfer of array data between the kernel and the browser,
and for avoiding unnecessary retransmission of data. It also includes features to
facilitate extensibility and interoperability between different consumers. In this
manner, a dataset created or used by one package can easily be reused by another package,
without extra resource usage.

In order to reduce double-work across the fragmented landscape of visualisation
libraries, an effort has also been made into creating high-quality, reusable
components. This allows visualisation library authors to focus more on their
unique features, while sharing the load of common tasks across multiple projects.
This includes work on:

\begin{itemize}
\item a set of common 3D plotting components, e.g. a set of 3D grids/axes.
\item a component for rending a color bar.
\item utilities for creating and using colormaps.
\item other scales for transforming data from one domain to another.
\end{itemize}

We contributed to the existing jupyter-widgets (ipywidgets) and the widget cookie
cutter project to make it easier to embed and share widgets with
others. \ODK's contributions are namely:

\begin{itemize}
\item sharing an HTML conversion of the notebook including widgets.
\item exporting certain widgets from a notebook to standalone HTML pages.
\item including widgets in package/library documentation.
\end{itemize}

An effort has also been made by \ODK to help ease the creation and distribution of Jupyter widget libraries. This is critical in order to ease adaption of the visualisation libraries based on Jupyter widgets. Notable contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item work done on the widget cookie cutter projects, in order to simplify and standardize best practices for widget packaging. \ODK contributed to improving this existing project.
\item the creation of an extension manager for JupyterLab, that also knows how to handle companion packages for kernels. \ODK contributed this functionality to the existing JupyterLab project.
\end{itemize}

  \caption{Extension manager for JupyterLab. Contributed to help ease distribution of developed widget libraries.}
  %\label{fig:lab-extmngr}
\end{figure}

As a result, all Jupyter widget authors can benefit from the work of \ODK,
making it more efficient and accessible to create, distribute,
and install custom Jupyter widget-based projects.


\subsection{Working with the community}\label{community}

During the extent of the work task, we organized two workshops focused on 3D visualisation.
One was at XFEL (22 June 2018) in relation to the \href{https://opendreamkit.org/2018/06/20/Hamburg-DisseminationWorkshop-SteeringMeeting/}{project meeting} and was meant to bring together the relevant stakeholders (developers and consumers) of the work. The other was held at the University of Silesia (16-19 July 2018), and focused on integration and interoperability between K3D-jupyter and other visualisation libraries.

Additionally, we participated in a community organized workshop on Jupyter widgets (23-26 January 2018, Ecole Polytechnique, Paris, France). The stated goal of this workshop was to "[g]et Jupyter Widgets developers to meet for a week of coding sessions with a few presentations" and to "[...] foster synergy, get everybody to meet, and resolve common issues".


\subsection{New 3D visualisation tools}\label{new-3d}

\subsubsection{K3D-jupyter}

K3D-jupyter is a package created by \ODK which provides the fast and simple 3d
plotting tool in the Jupyter notebook. The primary aim of K3D is to be
easy for use as stand alone package like matplotlib, but also to
allow interoperation with existing libraries as VTK. The power of
ipywidgets makes it also a fast and performant visualisation tool for
HPC computing e.g. fluid dynamics.


\subsubsection{unray}


unray is a scientific visualisation package created by \ODK for Jupyter notebooks for displaying
scalar data on unstructured tetrahedral meshes. It allows for various volumetric
rendering modes, isosurface rendering, and segment rendering.
It relies on pythreejs, and the reusable components outline above to handle
user control and interaction beyond the specific needs of the volumetric
rendering.

\subsubsection{SciviJS}

\href{https://demo.logilab.fr/SciviJS/}{SciviJS} is a new general javascript library
developed by \ODK for visualising volumetric data.
It is built on threejs, and enables GUI-based interactive exploration of mesh data
on a regular webpage, without any special software.
Additionally, a \emph{jupyter-scivijs} package enables using SciviJS from within
Jupyter notebooks.

\subsection{Lattice-Boltzmann visualisation}

The Lattice Boltzmann method has recently became a very popular method
in computational fluid mechanics. The most popular variant is based on
regular grids which makes it very efficient on GPU architectures. This
makes in turn very important to have web based visualisation tool, as
it is very common to run the simulation on the remove GPU server using
jupyter notebook interface.

We have equipped K3D-jupyter package in few features which make the
visualisation of boundary conditions and fields in computational
fluid dynamics especially easy:

\begin{itemize}
\item We have added a native method for displaying voxel geometry,
  which performance and quality is appropriate for typical geometries
  in LBM.
\item There are available standard functions for plotting vectors and lines.
\item There exists specialized method for displaying cross section of
  a computational domain, optimized for real time update during the
  simulation (K3D.texture).
\item Volume rendering is supported, which is very powerful tool in
  visualisation of scalar fields.
\item K3D objects can be dynamically updated during the simulation.
\end{itemize}

Additionally K3D-jupyter can be easily used in a VTK pipeline and
therefore it can display various sophisticated visualisation
methods. It also extends most of its CFD capabilities beyond regular
grid based the LBM simulations and make it viable tool for any CFD
package.

An important aspect of K3D development was to provide a tool for
displaying live LBM simulation without any performance penalty. The
classical approach was usually to store all fields to files for
postprocessing done usually in software like paraview. Live inspection
of data during a simulation was very limited.  If one takes, a typical
simulation taking place on GPU, then it is not uncommon to have it
running with 1 GLUPS (giga lattice updates per second) on modern
hardware. It means that the full velocity field in each time iteration
would need bandwidth c.a. 12 GB/s. Those numbers are many orders of
magnitude higher than capabilities of web connection.  The reasonable
solution is to perform some visualisation on GPU and send a reduced
dataset to the web-browser. We have experimented with two such
methods: a slice of the data and tracer particles. In sailfish-cfd we
have implemented a method which can on request do a 2d slice through
the computational domain. The slice is done in GPU memory and at not
point the whole dataset is transferred to the host. Then we fetch the
slice and display the data using k3d.texture function. In this way it
is possible to monitor a running simulation with very high refresh
rate inside the Jupyter notebook.
