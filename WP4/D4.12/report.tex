\section{Introduction}

The \href{https://jupyter.org}{Jupyter Notebook} is a web application
that enables the creation and sharing of executable documents
containing live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.
In particular, Jupyter is used actively for interactive and exploratory computations,
often involving visualization of data.

Because Jupyter is a web-based application,
it can benefit from developments in the wider community development of visualization tools for the web, in which there is a lot of activity.
The primary task for developing visualization tools in Jupyter is providing tools for connecting
"kernel" code, where the user's code runs,
to visualization code running in the browser.
Two-dimensional visualization in Jupyter is an area with popular and well-established tools
such as \href{https://matplotlib.org}{matplotlib}, \href{https://bokeh.pydata.org/}{bokeh}, and \href{https://altair-viz.github.io}{altair},
but there have been fewer mature solutions for three-dimensional visualization in Jupyter.
It is an area of active exploration,
so we first set out to identify the current state of the art for 3D visualization in Jupyter,
and determine where our efforts could best be placed.
We did this in the form of a report on the landscape of 3D visualization in Jupyter in 2017.

The Jupyter ecosystem includes a collection of projects called `Jupyter Widgets,'
which is a widely used system for providing bidirectional communcation
between the kernel and the browser.
The widgets provide a powerful and extensible system and we chose to use it as our basis for development of new visualization tools,
and focused our efforts with existing tools on improving compatibility with the Jupyter Widgets system.

For this deliverable, we aim to accomplish two main tasks: To better
understand the existing landscape of community efforts for three-dimensional
visualization in notebooks and to contribute where we may have the best
impact, whether it be in contributing to existing projects or creating new
tools. We have accomplished both. In particular, we have helped improve the
core Jupyter Widgets framework and the JupyterLab application, and we have
developed new software in the K3D, ipyscales, ipydatawidgets, and others.

\section{Impact}

We have developed several new software packages and contributed to the core Jupyter widget frameworks used by hundreds of thousands of people.

\subsection{Report on the landscape of 3D visualization}\label{landscape}

To identify where to most effectively put our efforts,
we examined the landscape of existing 3D visualization projects,
included in appendix \ref{landscape}.
We observed several existing projects with various levels of maturity and activity, and different strengths and weaknesses.
The primary conclusions of the report were that 1. \href{https://threejs.org}{three.js} is a good candidate as a common ground on which 3D visualization tools could be built because it is an active project and already in use by several tools, and 2. the Jupyter Widgets provide a good system for implementing communication between the Jupyter kernel and the browser.
This report helped us spend our efforts most effectively,
but is a useful guide in its own right for observing the state of
