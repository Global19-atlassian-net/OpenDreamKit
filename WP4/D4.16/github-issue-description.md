The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) is a web application that enables the creation and sharing of executable documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. Key features include Jupyter widgets which enable interactive visualization and can be composed to create full-featured interactive applications.

In this report, we explore the potential of Jupyter widgets for (pure) mathematics. The unique challenge comes from the huge variety of mathematical objects that the user may want to visualize and interact with, and the variety of graphical representations.

Over the course of four PM's, we pursued two main directions: the interactive visualization and edition of combinatorial objects ([sage-combinat-widgets](https://github.com/sagemath/sage-combinat-widgets)) and the interactive exploration of Sage features based on a display of mathematical objects enriched with contextual semantic information ([sage-combinat-explorer](https://github.com/sagemath/sage-explorer)).
