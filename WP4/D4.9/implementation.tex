\section{Implementation}\label{sec:impl}
The implementation of in-situ computation is organized along the information model outlined in
the last section.
It is realized as a set of Javascript modules in the JOBAD framework~\cite{JOBAD:on}, a Javascript framework for instrumenting (active) documents with user interactions; see~\cite{GLR:WebSvcActMathDoc09} for details.

We will first discuss unit conversion (see Section~\ref{sec:ex:units}) as a special case of in-situ computation and then generalize to the case of a non-trivial context and generalize to arbitrary computations in Section~\ref{sec:impl:general}.

\subsection{Unit Conversion}\label{sec:impl:units}
Unit conversion is a special case of in-situ computation, because
\begin{compactitem}
\item the computations are essentially limited to unit conversion and
\item context is trivial, since the computational objects -- the quantity expressions -- consist only of a number and a unit expression. The units are all defined constants and local identifiers do not exist.
\end{compactitem}
Ulrich Rabenstein of the KWARC group has implemented a semantics extraction procedure that finds quantity expression in HTML5 documents, analyzes them their content structure and represents them in content MathML and stored as (standoff) RDF annotations.
These can be used to feed in-situ computations.

The user interface for unit conversion can be implemented directly in JOBAD by delegating the conversion (the content MathML representation of the quantity expressions has sufficient information) to a unit converter -- we use the units package from Astropy~\cite{astropy}, an extendible python library for astronomy -- whose result can be converted to Presentation MathML for inclusion in the document.
We show the user interaction here.

Before starting to convert something, the user can highlight all quantity expressions in a given document.
This results in a document, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:highlight}.
We further use this snippet as an example.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=12cm]{screenshots/highlight}}
    \caption{Highlighting Quantity Expressions in \cite{physics/9807021}}\label{fig:highlight}
\end{figure}

In the first case, the user wants to convert a unit in just one expression to an equivalent one, say watt to horsepower.
For that, she can right-click on this particular expression and choose a target unit (e.g.  horsepower) from the list of units that are equivalent to Watt.
Figure~\ref{fig:convertone} demonstrates this and Figure~\ref{fig:convertoneresult} displays the result of the computation.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{subfigure}{8cm}
    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{screenshots/convertone}}
    \caption{Choosing A Target Unit}\label{fig:convertone}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}{7.5cm}
    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=7cm]{screenshots/convertoneresult}}
    \caption{The Result of converting one QE}\label{fig:convertoneresult}
    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=7cm]{screenshots/si}}
    \caption{Converting a Document To SI}\label{fig:si}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{In-Situ Unit Conversion}\label{fig:unit-conversion}
\end{figure}

The current example only allows local conversions, but of course the user also wants to convert units document-wide -- ideally from one system of measurement to another.
Figure~\ref{fig:si} shows the result of a prototypical implementation, which converts all units to irreducible SI base units.
This could, for instance, be extended to automatically convert all quantity expressions in a document from imperial to metric units and vice versa.

\subsection{A General Framework for In-Situ Computation}\label{sec:impl:general}

In addition to the example above, we have also implemented a prototype of the general in-situ computation manager detailed above.
A right click on a formula $F$ triggers the JOBAD menu, which has an ``Active Computation'' field.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item First, the \textbf{context extractor}, a function that for all the \lstinline|ci| elements in the content formula $C$ associated with $F$, and tries to find the associated variable declarations by going up the parent chain of $F$ and the symbol declarations from the home theory.
  Note that using the content MathML representation $C$ of $F$ gets us around disambiguation problems: even if the presentation of $F$ is ambiguous (e.g. by using variable or constant names multiple times), $C$ is not.
  \item The variable context is displayed to the user prompting instantiation in a popup form: the \textbf{in-situ computation manager} (see Figure~\ref{fig:compman}, which allows to give values for the components of the equation, pick different actions (simplification, equation solving, \ldots ) and ways of providing the results (in-place, footnote, \ldots ).
  As the current system is only a prototype, one can currently only select the Evalutation Action.
  \item In a second step, the  user-supplied values are parsed into content MathML, inserted into $C$, yielding the content MathML expression $C'$, which is then shipped to the computational engine.
  Currently we only support the MMT system as a computational engine, but this is not a restriction, since MMT can delegate computations to engines like GAP, Sage, PARI, \ldots via the SCSCP protocol~\cite{ODK-D3.3}.
  \item Finally, the result $R$ of computing $C'$ -- a content MathML expression -- is inserted back into the original computation context.
  This context can then be presented in presentation MathML and inserted into the document according to the method the user selected \footnote{
  Currently, the system presents the user with the computed context directly. }.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Code Availability, Licensing and Demos}

For both of the examples in this section, an implementation is available under Open Source license terms.
For reasons of lacking MathML support in other browsers, we have only tested these demos in Firefox.

A demo of the unit conversion is available at \url{http://ash.eecs.jacobs-university.de/}.
A user can first select a document and then repeat the procedure detailed above in Section~\ref{sec:impl:units}.
The source code of the demo is available in the repository at \url{https://gl.kwarc.info/urabenstein/Semanticextraction/tree/master/server}.
The server can be executed locally following the steps in the corressponding README file.

A protoype of the General Framework for In-Situ Computation is also availble.
It can be found at \url{http://ash.eecs.jacobs-university.de/prototype/} and shows the basics of the process explained in Section~\ref{sec:impl:general}.
it consists of a frontend component, the source code of which can be found at \url{https://gl.mathhub.info/ODK/ActiveComputationDemo}, as well as a backend component inside the MMT system.
The source code to the backend component can be found at \url{https://github.com/UniFormal/MMT/tree/master/src/mmt-odk/src/info/kwarc/mmt/odk/activecomp}.
