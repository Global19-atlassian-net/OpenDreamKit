One of the most prominent features of a virtual research environment (VRE) is a unified user interface (UI). There are two complementary approaches that can serve as a basis for OpenDreamKit's mathematical VRE UI: computational notebooks and active structured documents. The former allows for mathematical text around the computation cells of a real-eval-print loop of a mathematical computational system and the latter makes semantically annotated documents active.

In D4.2 “Active/Structured Documents Requirements and existing Solutions” (#91) we reported on two systems in the OpenDreamKit project which follow respectively those two approaches: [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) -- a notebook server for various computational systems -- and [MathHub.info](http://MathHub.info) -- a platform for active mathematical documents. We identified commonalities and differences and developed a vision for integrating their functionalities.

As a first step into this direction we explore in this deliverable the requirements of integrating in-situ (i.e. in-document) computation – a forte and indeed the raison-d'être of notebooks – into conventional, narrative-structured mathematical documents. We present, analyze, and classify examples for in-situ computation and explore -- in particular in a [MathHub.info](http://MathHub.info) based prototype -- how the active documents technology has to be extended to accommodate this functionality as a semantic service.
