One of the most prominent features of a virtual research environment (VRE) is a unified user interface. The OpenDreamKit approach is to create a mathematical VRE by integrating various pre-existing mathematical software systems. There are two approaches that can serve as a basis for the OpenDreamKit UI: *computational notebooks* and *active documents*. The former allow mathematical text around the computation cells of a real-eval-print loop of a mathematical software system and the latter make semantically annotated documents semantic.

We report on two systems in the OpenDreamKit project: Jupyter -- a notebook server for various kernels, and MathHub.info -- a platform for active mathematical documents. We identify commonalities and differences and develop a vision for integrating their functionalitities.
