\section{Report}
The default ``notebook'' in SageMath is now \texttt{sagenb\_export}.
This is a small web application, built on top of Jupyter,
which can convert Sage notebooks to Jupyter.
It also has buttons to run either the
old Sage notebook server or the new Jupyter notebook server.
See Figure~\ref{fig-export}.

An important use case of the notebook is \emph{interactive functions}:
these allow the user to control the input of a function
using \emph{widgets} such as sliders and text boxes.
See Figure~\ref{fig-interact-sagenb} for an example.
This way, the user can easily investigate how some function changes
when the input changes.
Once the interact is created, it can be used by people having no experience
at all with Sage or Python.
Interacts have been implemented independently in the Sage notebook
and in Jupyter (package \texttt{ipywidgets}).
For the conversion of Sage notebooks to Jupyter to be useful,
also interacts should work the same way.
This has been implemented in the SageMath Jupyter kernel:
see Figure~\ref{fig-interact-jupyter} for the same example as
Figure~\ref{fig-interact-sagenb}, this time in Jupyter.
