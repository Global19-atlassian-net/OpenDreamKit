\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}

We have presented the facilities for distributed, collaborative, and versioned editing in
the \sys system. \sys borrows much of the functionality from the
underlying \git and \GitHub\todo{github or gitlab?}
systems, but customizes them to the particular problem of authoring, maintaining, and
curating highly structured knowledge bases of flexiformal mathematical knowledge.
