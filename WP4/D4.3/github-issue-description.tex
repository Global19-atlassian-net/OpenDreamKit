One of the most prominent features of a virtual research environment
(VRE) is a unified user interface. The OpenDreamKit approach is to
create a mathematical VRE by integrating various pre-existing
mathematical software systems. There are two approaches that can serve
as a basis for the OpenDreamKit UI: \emph{computational notebooks} and
\emph{active documents}. The former allow mathematical text around the
computation cells of a real-eval-print loop of a mathematical software
system and the latter make semantically annotated documents semantic.

We report on two systems in the OpenDreamKit project: Jupyter -- a
notebook server for various kernels, and MathHub.info -- a platform for
active mathematical documents. We identify commonalities and differences
and develop a vision for integrating their functionalitities.
