One of the most prominent features of a virtual research environment (VRE) is a unified user interface. The OpenDreamKit approach is to create a mathematical VRE by integrating various pre-existing mathematical software systems. There are two approaches that can serve as a basis for the \pn UI: ```computational notebooks``` and ```active documents```. The former allow mathematical text around the computation cells of a real-eval-print loop of a mathematical software system and the latter make semantically annotated documents semantic. 

MathHub is a portal for active mathematical documents ranging from formal libraries of theorem provers to informal – but rigorous – mathematical documents lightly marked up by preserving LaTeX markup. In the OpenDreamKit project MathHub acts as:

* A portal and management system for theory-graph structured active documents, i.e. documents that use the semantic structure of the document and the knowledge context it links to to render semantic services embedded in the document – it becomes active, i.e. interactive, reactive - see #91. 

* The repository for the Math-in-the-Middle (MitM) ontology (see #136). This ontology is used as a basis for interoperability of the mathematical software systems that make up the OpenDreamKit VRE toolkit, which is a crucial concern for work package WP6.

As the authoring, maintenance and curation of theory-structured mathematical ontologies and the transfer of mathematical knowledge via active documents are an important part of the OpenDreamKit VRE toolkit, the editing facilities in MathHub play a great role for the project. 
This report discusses the main design decisions of the editing facilities in MathHub; they can be assessed at http://mathhub.info.
