\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\sys is a portal for active mathematical documents ranging from formal libraries
of theorem provers to informal -- but rigorous -- mathematical documents lightly marked up
by preserving {\LaTeX} markup. In the \pn project \sys acts as the repository for the
Math-in-the-Middle Ontology (see~\cite{DehKohKon:iop16,ODK-D6.2}). This ontology is a
portal and management system for theory-graph structured active documents. 

In Section~\ref{sec:mathhub} we briefly present the \sys system as a basis and in
Section~\ref{sec:editing} we drill in on the editing-specific system
features. Section~\ref{sec:concl} concludes the report.
