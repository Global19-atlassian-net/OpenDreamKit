\subsection{ System Architecture and Realization}\label{sec:arch}

\sys is realized as an instance of the Planetary System~\cite{Kohlhase:ppte12}, which we
have substantially extended in the course of the work reported here.

The system architecture has three main components: 
\begin{compactenum}[\em i\rm)]
 \item a versioned \emph{data store} holding the source documents
 \item a \emph{semantic service provider} that imports the source documents and provides services for them 
 \item and a \emph{frontend} that makes the sources and the semantic services available to users.
\end{compactenum}
Specifically, we use the GitLab repository manager~\cite{GitLab:on} as the data store, the
\mmt API as the semantic service provider and Drupal as the frontend.

Figure~\ref{fig:arch} shows the detailed architecture.

\caption{The \sys Architecture}\label{fig:arch}

In this setup, Drupal serves as a container management system\footnote{Drupal and similar
  systems self-describe as content management systems, but they actually only manage the
  documents without changing their internal structure.} that supplies uniform theming,
user management, discussion forums, etc. GitLab on the other hand, provides versioned
storage of the content documents, and organizes them into repositories owned by users and
groups. 
The advantage of this setup is that we can combine two methods for accessing the
contents of \sys: 
\begin{compactenum}[\em i\rm)]
\item an online, web-based editing/interaction workflow for the casual user, in the spirit
  of the Planetary system and
\item (new) an offline editing/authoring workflow based on a GIT working copy.
\end{compactenum}
The latter is important for power authors and for bulk editing jobs. A user can fork or
pull the relevant repositories from GitLab, edit them and submit them back to \sys
either via a pull request to the repository masters or a direct commit/push. As the
content is usually highly networked and distributed across multiple GIT repositories, we
have developed a command line tool \texttt{lmh} (\underline{l}ocal
\underline{M}ath\underline{H}ub) that manages working copies across repository
borders. 

In the web-based system, semantic services (notation-based, presentation, definition
lookup, relational navigation, dependency management, etc.) are provided by \mmt and are
made available to the user, primarily by dedicated JOBAD~\cite{GLR:WebSvcActMathDoc09}
modules.  Note that even though the active document functionalities and semantic editing
support in \sys are based on \omdoc/\mmt representation of the content, the
authors interact with the content in the source format. Both of these representations are
versioned in GitLab and are converted into \omdoc/\mmt by custom
transformers. \texttt{lmh} also supports running these transformers locally and previewing
HTML5 renderings of the generated \omdoc/\mmt.

In order to to deal with flexiformal mathematical content in \omdoc, we have also extended
the \mmt API, which was previously restricted to fully formal content. In the extended
\mmt API, each \mmt service works whenever it is theoretically applicable (e.g. type
checking when there exists type information, change management when there is dependency
information, etc.).

\subsection{Deployment and Content}

\sys is deployed at \url{http://mathhub.info} and has reached a state, where it can be
used for initial experiments and resources, but has not been scaled much beyond 10\,000
documents and a couple of dozens or users and repositories yet.

Specifically, we are currently hosting a test set of formal and informal mathematical
content to develop and evaluate system functionality; concretely:
\begin{compactenum}[\em i\rm)]
\item the SMGloM termbase with ca. 1500 small \sTeX files containing definitions of
  mathematical terminology and notation definitions.
\item ca. 6500 files with \sTeX-encoded teaching materials (slides, course notes,
  problems, and solutions) in Computer Science,
\item the LATIN logic atlas with ca. 1000 meta-theories and logic morphisms,
\item the Mizar Mathematical Library of ca. 1000 articles with ca. 50.000 theorems,
  definitions, and proofs, and
\item a part of the HOL Light Library with 22 theories and over 2800 declarations.
\end{compactenum}
Already now, it is unique in its class in that it gives a unified interface to multiple
theorem prover libraries together with linguistic and educational resources. Now that the
ground work has been laid, we anticipate the rapid integration of new semantic services,
editing support and new content.

For the \pn project, we have developed and are hosting on \sys
\begin{compactenum}
\item the ``Math-in-the-Middle ontology''~\cite{MitM:on}, which hosts a flexiformal
  development of the mathematical knowledge for system interoperability in \pn
  (see~\cite{DehKohKon:iop16,ODK-D6.2}),
\item the ``ODK System ontologies''~\cite{ODKsysonto:on}, a collection of \omdoc/\mmt
  theories and codecs that describe the mathematical content of the LMFDB and other data
  sources, bridging the internal (i.e. system/database oriented) and external
  (mathematical) views of the content.
\end{compactenum}
