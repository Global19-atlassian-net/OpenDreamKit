Version control tools, such as Git and Mercurial, have become an
integral part of open and collaborative science and software. Version
control tools allow proposed changes to be reviewed (`diffing') and
resolve conflicts through combination of changes (`merging'). Jupyter
notebook documents are stored in text files as JSON formatted data. This
makes them well suited to tracking in version control, but the JSON
structure can make diffing and merging difficult.

For this deliverable, we have developed the \texttt{nbdime} tool for
diffing and merging notebook documents with awareness of the structured
nature of the documents, allowing a significantly improved experience
over na√Øve text-file diffing and merging tools. \texttt{nbdime} can be
integrated into the popular git version control system, maximizing
impact on common developer workflows.
