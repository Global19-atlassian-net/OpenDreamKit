The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) is a web application that enables the creation and sharing of executable documents which contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Thanks to a modular design, Jupyter can be used with any computational system that provides a so-called [_Jupyter kernel_](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/kernels.html) implementing the [_Jupyter messaging protocol_](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to communicate with the notebook. OpenDreamKit therefore promotes the Jupyter notebook as user interface of choice, in particular since it is particularly suitable for building modular web based Virtual Research Environments.

This deliverable aims at ODK's main computational components all having basic Jupyter kernels implemented and distributed. Full featured Jupyter interfaces will follow up in deliverable [D4.7](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/96). The SageMath Jupyter kernel is a foundation for [D4.5](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/94): Sage notebook / Jupyter notebook convergence.

We have implemented basic kernels for:
- [x] GAP:
    - [x] https://github.com/gap-packages/jupyter-gap
    - [x] [pip package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jupyter-kernel-gap)
    - [x] Optional SageMath package: [trac #21416](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21416)
    - [ ] SageMathCloud integration
    - [x] Features: TAB-completion, documentation lookup, code introspection, output history, interruption, timing, debugger
    - Upcoming features in [D4.7](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/96): syntax highlighting (should just require installing Code Mirror's syntax file for GAP), pretty printing, 2D/3D plots, live manual.
- [x] PARI/GP:
    - [x] https://github.com/jdemeyer/pari_jupyter
    - [x] [pip package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pari_jupyter)
    - [x] Optional SageMath package: [trac #19372](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19372), [#19992](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19992), [#22177](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22177)
    - [ ] SageMathCloud integration
    - [x] Features: TAB-completion, (short) documentation lookup, output history, interruption, timing, 2D plots
    - Upcoming features in [D4.7](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/96): syntax highlighting, pretty printing, long documentation lookup, live manual?, code introspection?, debugger
- [x] Singular:
    - [x] https://github.com/sebasguts/jupyter-singular
    - [x] [pip package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jupyter-kernel-singular/)
    - [x] Optional SageMath package: [trac #22378](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22378)
    - [x] SageMathCloud integration
    - [x] Features: TAB completion, static 3D plots generated by surf, basic support for interactive widgets (IPyWidgets).
    - Upcoming features in [D4.7](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/96): live 3D plots, ...

Meanwhile, the following Jupyter kernel has been implemented by the community, with some help of the ODK participants:
- [x] SageMath (built on top of Jupyter's Python kernel)
    - [x] see this series of [trac tickets](https://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=closed&summary=~Jupyter&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority)
    - [x] Part of the SageMath distribution
    - [x] SageMathCloud integration
    - [x] Features: TAB-completion, syntax highlighting, pretty printing, 2D/3D plots, documentation lookup, live manual, code introspection, output history, interruption, timing, debugger.
    - Interactive widgets (IPyWidgets): see [D4.5](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/94)
  
Finally, the following kernel has been made available within SageMath:
- [x] R: see trac [#19427](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19427)
