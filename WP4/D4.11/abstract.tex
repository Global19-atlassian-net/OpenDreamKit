  In this report we present a prototypical integration of the Jupyter notebooks into the MathHub.info portal for active mathematical documents and a versioned hosting system for flexiformal mathematics.
  MathHub.info offers a rich interface for reading, writing, and interacting with mathematical documents and knowledge. Jupyter offers a uniform interface to the computation facilities of the OpenDreamKit VRE in the form of a read-eval-print loop (REPL). 

  After specifying an integration of active documents with REPL facilities (Jupyter) in D4.2 and exploring in-document computation in D4.9 we report on the integration of the back-ends: providing an MMT kernel for Jupyter (knowledge management and Math-in-the-Middle-based distributed computation (see D6.5)). We show how the new Jupyter widgets can be deeply integrated with the MMT knowledge management facilities to give semantics-aware interaction facilities.

  We show and evaluate the integration on two case studies: in-document computing facilities in active documents and a knowledge-based specification dialog for modeling and simulation.
