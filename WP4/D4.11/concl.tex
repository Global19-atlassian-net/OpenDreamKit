\ednote{@MK: read and revise}

We have presented an integration of the two front-end components in the OpenDreamKit project: Jupyter for computation/experimentation and MathHub.info for interative mathematical documents. The prerequisite for this integration is progress at the back-end: mainly a MMT kernel for Jupyter: MMT is the system that drives semantic services in MathHub.info, and the new kernel now makes a tight integration possible at the front-end levels. We have evaluated the reach of the eavluation on two case studies: A 

Jupyter kernel for MMT along with an integration of Jupyter notebooks into MathHub.
Moreover, we have indicated how to use the resulting system as an integrated fronted for the MitM-based semantic VRE that is developed in parallel. \ednote{@MK: add reference to D 6.8}
Future work will focus on maturing this integration and build the overall MitM VRE.
