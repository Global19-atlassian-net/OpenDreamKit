We have presented an integration of three systems in the OpenDreamKit project:
Jupyter for computation/experimentation in notebooks and MathHub for interactive mathematical documents as well as MMT for describing the semantics of the knowledge contained in the former.
We have evaluated the reach of the evaluation in several case studies.

The resulting system serves as an intermediate step towards the full OpenDreamKit Virtual Research Environment.
While this report focuses on the integration of documents and notebooks in a unified system, other deliverables have built other components of the envisioned environment: the Math-in-the-Middle ontology \cite{ODK-D6.8} and the instantation of the MitM framework with concrete mathematical computation and database systems ~\cite{ODK-D6.5}.
Future work will focus on merging and scaling up these development strands.
