\ednote{@MK: read and revise}

We have presented a Jupyter kernel for MMT along with an integration of Jupyter notebooks intto MathHub.
Moreover, we have indicated how to use the resulting system as an integrated fronted for the MitM-based semantic VRE that is developed in parallel. \ednote{@MK: add reference to D 6.8}
Future work will focus on maturing this integration and build the overall MitM VRE.
