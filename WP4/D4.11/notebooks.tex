We have installed a Jupyter server as a component of our MathHub system.
It provides a normal Jupyter server except for additionally supporting our MMT kernel.
It is available at the URL \url{jupyter.mathhub.info}.\ednote{@Kai: check this}

When displaying a notebook in MathHub, a special button appears that allows users to open the notebook in the associated Jupyter server.
\ednote{@Kai, @Tom: check this, do the implementation}

\ednote{KA: write some demo notebooks stored in gl.mathhub.info, including the one corresponding to the example in the previous section}

\ednote{KA: show a screenshot of the example notebook from the previous section in jupyter.mathhub.info}
