\subsection{MitM-Based Formalized Mathematics in MathHub Notebooks}

The MitM approach inside OpenDreamKit uses the MMT language for formalizing mathematical background knowledge and the MMT system for integrating computation tools.
Therefore, Jupyter-MMT notebooks can serve as a unified user interface for MitM systems.

For example, consider the theory at \url{https://gl.mathhub.info/ODK/lmfdb/blob/master/source/schemas/tutorial_example.mmt}, which serves as our standard example for the interaction between MMT and LMFDb (a big database of mathematical objects that was integrated with MMT in previous deliverables of OpenDreamKit).
We can now rewrite it as a notebook.\ednote{@Kai: prepare the notebook, add a link and a screenshot here}
