  The implementation of in-situ computation is organized along the information model
  outlined in the last section. It is realized as a Javascript module in the JOBAD
  framework, a\ednote{MK: continue} 
  

  A right click on a formula $F$ triggers the JOBAD menu, which has a ``compute with me''
  field, which triggers
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The \textbf{context extractor}, a function that for all the \lstinline|ci|
    elements in the content formula $C$ associated with $F$, tries to find the associated
    variable declarations by going up the parent chain of $F$ and the symbol declarations
    from the home theory -- the latter is functionality provided by the MMT system.
  \item The variable context is displayed to the user prompting instantiation.
  \end{itemize}
