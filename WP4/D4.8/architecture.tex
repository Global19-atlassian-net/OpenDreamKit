\section{Information Architecture}\label{sec:infarch}

Documents have Math Objects (enoded in content and presentation mathml)\ednote{the former
  may be in the content commons in the Active Documents Figure} and the documents have a
context \ednote{The guy from Eindhoven had something about document and user context
  here. Cite him and remember what he did.} that explains/binds all symbols in the
object. This context must be some how represented in the document and has to be
transmitted to the computation service.
