\section{Information Architecture}\label{sec:infarch}

Documents have Math Objects (enoded in content and presentation mathml)\ednote{the former
  may be in the content commons in the Active Documents Figure} and the documents have a
context \ednote{The guy from Eindhoven had something about document and user context
  here.~\cite{Verrijzer:cimdpm15} in the context of the MathDox system~\cite{mathdox:on}}
that explains/binds all symbols in the object. This context must be some how represented
in the document and has to be transmitted to the computation service.
