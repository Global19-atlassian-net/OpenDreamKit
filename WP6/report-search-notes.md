# Task 6.?? - Jupyter Notebook Search

- Pre-existing MathWebSearch system: Formula search
    - indexes Content MathML "harvests" generated by harvesters
    - can then answer queries with placeholders
    - e.g archive.org latex-based harvester + search
- for this task: built infrastructure for managing large harvests and building interfaces
    - auto-updating of index
    - deployment setup => being able to spin up new instances more easily
    - api wrapper (more flexible frontends)
    - flexible way of dropping in harvesters
- use this for formulae in Jupyter notebooks
    - generated as output from sage (using github api + latexml)
    - build a query language using native latex formulae
- additionally built an NLab Harvester
- evaluation
