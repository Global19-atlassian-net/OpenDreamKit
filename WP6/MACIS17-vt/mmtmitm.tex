\section{Virtual Research Environments for Mathematics: the Math-in-the-Middle
  Approach}\label{sec:mmtmitm}

The work reported in this paper originates from in the EU-funded \textsf{OpenDreamKit}
\cite{OpenDreamKit:on} project that aims to create virtual research environments (VRE)
enabling mathematicians to make efficient use of existing open-source mathematical
knowledge systems.  These systems include computer algebra systems like SageMath and GAP
as well as mathematical data bases such as the \lmfdb, which must be made interoperable
for integration into a VRE. In the \textsf{OpenDreamKit} project we have developed the
Math-in-the-Middle (MitM) approach, which posits a central ontology of mathematical
knowledge, which acts as a pivot point for interoperability; see~\cite{DehKohKon:iop16}
for a description of the approach and \cite{KohMuePfe:kbimss17} for a technical refinement
and large-scale interoperability case study.

  \caption{The MiTM Approach to Connecting Systems.}\label{fig:mitmconnect}\vspace*{-1em}
\end{wrapfigure}
The MitM ontology in the center of Figure~\ref{fig:mitmconnect} models the true,
underlying mathematical semantics in \ommt and allows translation between this centrally
formalized knowledge and the systems on the boundary via views and alignments.
This mathematical knowledge is modeled using the well-established theory graph paradigm
and is stored inside our \ommt-based MathHub system~\cite{MathHub:on}. 

The knowledge in the mathematical software systems -- denoted by square boxes in
Figure~\ref{fig:mitmconnect} -- also modeled via \ommt theory graphs the \textbf{API
  theories} -- the corresponding red circles; these are generated from the
knowledge bases in the systems by a custom process. The API theories allow us to implement
translation with the help of \ommt views and alignments between the ontology -- the
Math-In-The-Middle -- and each of the systems and use these translations for transporting
computational tasks between the systems. 

The realization of the MitM approach crucially depends on the information architecture of
the \ommt language~\cite{Kohlhase:OMDoc1.2,RabKoh:WSMSML13} and its implementation in the
\mmt system~\cite{Rabe:MAGMS13,uniformal:on}.

In \ommt knowledge is organized in \textbf{theories}, which contain information about
mathematical concepts and objects in the form of \textbf{declarations}. Theories are
organized into an ``object-oriented'' inheritance structure via \textbf{inclusions} and
\textbf{structures} (for controlled multiple inheritance), which is augmented via
truth-preserving mappings between theories called \textbf{views}, which allow to relate
concepts of pre-existing theories and transport theorems between these. Inclusions,
structures, and views impose a graph structure on the represented mathematical knowledge,
called a \textbf{theory graph}. 

We observe that even very large mathematical knowledge spaces about abstract mathematical
domains can be represented by small, but densely connected, theory graphs, if we make all
inherited material explicit in a process called \textbf{flattening}. The \ommt language
provides systematic names (\mmt URIs) for all objects, properties, and relations in the
induced knowledge space, and given the represented theory graph, the \mmt system can
compute them on demand. 

Generally, knowledge in a knowledge space given by a theory graph loaded by the \mmt system can be accessed by either giving it's \mmt URI, or by uniquely describing it via a set of conditions. 
To achieve the latter, \mmt has a Query Language called QMT~\cite{Rabe:qlfml12}, which allows even complex conditions to be specified. 
Currently, the \mmt system loads the theory graph into main memory at startup and interleaves incremental flattening and query evaluation operations on the \mmt data structures until the result has been produced. 

In \cite{KohMuePfe:kbimss17} we show that the MitM approach, its \ommt-based realization,
and distribution via the SCSCP protocol are sufficient for distributed, federated computation
between multiple computer algebra systems (Sage, GAP, and Singular), and that the MitM
ontology of abstract group theory can be represented in \ommt efficiently. This setup is
effective because
\begin{compactitem}
\item the knowledge spaces behind abstract and computational mathematics can be represented in theory graphs very space-efficiently: The compression factors between a knowledge space and its theory graph -- we call it the \textbf{TG factor} -- exceeds two orders of magnitude even for small domains.
\item only small parts of the knowledge space are traversed for a given computation. 
\end{compactitem}

But the \textsf{OpenDreamKit} VRE must also include mathematical data sources like the \lmfdb or the OEIS, which contain millions of mathematical objects. For such knowledge sources, the classical \mmt system is not yet suitable:
\begin{compactitem}
\item the knowledge space corresponding to the data base content cannot be compressed by ``general mathematical principles'' like inheritance. 
Indeed, redundant information is already largely eliminated by the data base schema and the ``business logic'' of the information system it feeds.
\item typically large parts of the knowledge space need to be traversed to obtain the intended results to queries.
\end{compactitem}
Therefore, we extend the concept of \ommt theories -- which carry the implicit assumption of containing only a small number of declarations (see~\cite{FaGu:lt92} for a discussion) -- to \textbf{virtual theories}, which can have an unlimited (possibly infinite) number of declarations. 
To contrast the intended uses we will call the classical \ommt theories \textbf{concrete theories}.  
In practice, a virtual theory is represented by concrete approximations: \ommt works with a concrete theory, whose size changes dynamically as a suitable backend infrastructure generates declarations on demand.
