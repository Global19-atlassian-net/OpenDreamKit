# Summary

This paper, "Virtual theories -- a uniform interface to mathematical knowledge bases", describes exactly what its title says.  An abstraction of mathematical knowledge bases available online, and methods for uniformly accessing them.

The concrete and solution-oriented nature of the content made this paper a joy to read.  Clear and lucid descriptions of the problems of these systems gave strong motivation for their work.  And I felt like the project builds appropriately on prior work.  Diagrams were appropriate for explaining concepts and particulars.  I could definitely see the content of this paper, Math-in-the-Middle, emerging as a central unifying force for the disparate collections of knowledge we are collectively creating.

This reviewer strongly accepts this paper, with the following specific criticisms which should be addressed before final submission.

# Specific criticisms and praise

what mathematicians desire from a “programmatic, mathematical API”. --> why just mathematicians?  include other scientists, please

"iving an example a State-Of-The-Art Math- ematical Database alon" --> giving an example of a.  also, should state-of-the-art mathematical database be capitalized?  is it a proper noun, like, a real thing that i can download, and is perhaps a registered trademark?

"system can compute them by need." --> on demand?

"it defines a from_record con" --> space before `from_record`.  Similar issues appear in other places you used mono-spaced font for names of things.

I really liked the inclusion of fig 2, as an explicit example of the json.  with color!  thanks.

in section 3.2, text overlaps the image in fig 3.  please re-format

Our Diagnosis is that LMFDB– and most other mathe --> de-capitalize Diagnosis?

double impedance mismatch problem -- nice description.

fig 4 appeared to me to be stretched ever so slightly vertically.  also, consider adding texture in addition to color to help colorblind readers.

"example the degree field from Figure 2 above" --> space before degree

in 5.2, your paragraphs seem strongly sequential.  i beg for another diagram accompanying them.

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
This work is an exemplar synergy of robust software development skills,
thoughtful abstractions and productive interfacing of research teams and
interested parties towards much needed automation.

The generic pattern here is "the common language representation", so that
different systems (mathematical knowledge systems) would be connected through
this (linear complexity) rather than directly with one another (quadratic
complexity and syncing complications), with MMT being the language/framework
(here with the important introduction of virtual theory types),
Math-In-The-Middle being the semantics-aware and scalable paradigm/ontology, QMT
being the query language MathHub the storage platform and LMFDB the example
database (to mention some of the basic "agents" in this very interesting work).

Suggestions for (minor) improvements:

- Contrasting and emphasizing the "before" and "after" of this approach (from
  the user's perspective) would greatly add to the presentation part of the
  laborious efforts this manuscript describes: a very simple example of what
  he/she had to do before, what he/she has to do now to get to the information
  (perhaps starting from an expanded but simplified (step-by-step) version of
  the text boxes at the start and end of Section 6.

- Including a comparison with Mathematica and the associated computational
  knowledge, WolframAlpha, would help the reader position this work and most
  importantly its potential uses. I am mentioning Mathematica because it is an
  excellent example of a Problem Solving Environment [1], also trying to be
  truly universal (however and unfortunately, being a commercial product, hiding
  many of the related interesting details).
