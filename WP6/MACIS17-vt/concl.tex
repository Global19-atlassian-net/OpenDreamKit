\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}

We have shown how to extend the data model for theories of the \mmt system, and implemented a generic approach that does no longer require the theories to reside in the main memory; instead knowledge is retrieved from an external system and declarations are generated on demand.
The main conceptual leap here was to make a difference between the representations of objects in the database, and the underlying mathematical objects, and to translate between them using generic codecs. 
We have demonstrated that this approach is functional using the example of \lmfdb. 

The main advantages of this approach are, unlike existing interfaces to knowledges bases, its' generic design and easy extensibility. 
\begin{itemize}
\item To add a new \lmfdb database to the set of represented theories one in practice only
  has to add a new schema theory.  This schema theory will have to contain the sets of
  fields within this new database, along with their mathematical types and codecs.  All of
  these should be known to the database maintainers, albeit not directly as types and
  \identifier{codecs}, and are thus easy to find.  This schema theory can then be used to
  automatically generate a new database theory.
\item To add a knowledge base that uses a different data base, we also have to implement a
  new \mmt backend and -- possibly -- extend the set of CoDecs.
\end{itemize}

There are several other aspects which we have not detailed here as addition of Virtual Theories to \mmt impacts several other aspects of the system. 
For example, \mmt has a Query Language allowing users to query information available; the previous implementation relied on theories being concrete, which is no longer true for all theories.  
Furthermore, we are also planning to extend our implementation of Virtual Theories; e.g. we want to extend it to more than a few \lmfdb databases. 
We also have concrete plans for a second example based on OEIS\ednote{We had at some point at least}.
