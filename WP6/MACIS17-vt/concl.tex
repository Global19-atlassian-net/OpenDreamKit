\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}

We have interpreted Mathematical Knowledge Bases as \ommt theories. 
We have shown how to extend the data model of the \mmt system, and implemented a generic approach that does no longer require the theories to reside in the main memory; instead knowledge is retrieved from an external system and declarations are generated on demand.
The main conceptual leap here was to make a difference between the representations of objects in the database, and the underlying mathematical objects, and to translate between them using generic codecs. 
We have demonstrated that this approach is functional using the example of \lmfdb. 

The main advantages of this approach are, unlike existing interfaces to knowledges bases, its' generic design and easy extensibility. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    To add a new \lmfdb database to the set of represented theories one in practice only has to add a new schema theory. 
    This schema theory will have to contain the sets of fields within this new database, along with their mathematical types and codecs. 
    All of these should be known to the database maintainers, albeit not directly as types and \identifier{codecs}, and are thus easy to find. 
    This database theory can then be used to automatically generate a new database theory. 
  \item
    To add a different knowledge base, one does not need to re-invent the wheel either, although some more work is required. 
    The design of using a database and schema theory can be re-used, however this time the database theory will also have to be re-implemented. 
    Instead of communicating with the \lmfdb API, a different backend will need to be used. 
    Furthermore, a new sets of codecs, that code between the data structures used by this new backend, and mathematical objects, will have to be implemented. 
\end{itemize}

There are several other aspects which we have not detailed here as addition of Virtual Theories to \mmt impacts several other aspects of the system. 
For example, \mmt has a Query Language allowing users to query information available; the previous implementation relied on theories being concrete, which is no longer true for all theories.  
Furthermore, we are also planning to extend our implementation of Virtual Theories; e.g. we want to extend it to more than a few \lmfdb databases. 
We also have concrete plans for a second example based on OEIS\ednote{We had at some point at least}.
