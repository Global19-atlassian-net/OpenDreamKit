\subsection{Mixed Computational and Narrative Documents}\label{subsec:software}
Finally, for computational mathematical documents (the S aspect of D/K/S structures from the \pn proposal or the \textbf{narration} and \textbf{computation} aspects of the finer tetrapod model from Figure~\ref{fig:tetrapod}). Here we have developed a formula harvester for Jupyter notebooks and a formula search engine that builds on them (as envisioned in task \taskref{dksbases}{mws}).
