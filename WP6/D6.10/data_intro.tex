% Innovations based on mathematical knowledge and algorithms yield many improvements in science, engineering, economy, ecology, health care, security, and society overall. 
% For example, our global positioning system (GPS) needs the mathematics of relativistic physics, our mobile phones use frequencies allocated through combinatorial optimization, the combinatorics of our genome yields clues to curing rare diseases, the privacy of our communications depends on cryptographic protocols steeped in number theory, and our national security is relying on the mathematical analysis of increasingly complex networks. 
% Fundamental mathematical research and its direct application in practical situations enable many engineering, science, and business innovations that enrich society and mankind.\ednote{FR: throw out this paragraph? Or replace with one sentence?}

Modern mathematical research increasingly depends on collaborative tools, computational environments, and online databases, and these are changing the way mathematical research is conducted and how it is turned into applications.
For example, engineers now use mathematical tools to build and simulate physical models based on systems of differential equations with millions of variables, combining building blocks and algorithms taken from libraries shared all over the internet.

\paragraph{State of FAIRness for Mathematical Datasets}
Mathematical datasets are generally produced, published, and maintained with virtually no systematic attention to the FAIR principles~\cite{FAIR,WilDumAal:FAIR16} for making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.
In fact, often the sharing of data is an afterthought --- see~\cite{Bercic:cmo:wiki} for an overview of mathematical datasets and their ``FAIR-readiness''.

Moreover, the inherent complexity of mathematical data makes it very difficult to share in practice: even freely accessible datasets are often very hard or impossible to reuse, let alone make machine-interoperable because there is no systematic way of specifying the relation between the raw data and its mathematical meaning.  Therefore, unfortunately FAIR mathematics essentially does not exist today.

\paragraph{Motivation}
Our ultimate goal is to standardize a framework for representing mathematical datasets.
As a first step, we present \dmh, an infrastructure for systematically sharing relational datasets.

Such a standard for FAIR data representations in mathematics would lead to several incidental benefits:
\begin{compactitem}
\item increased productivity for mathematicians by allowing them to focus on the mathematical datasets themselves while leaving issues of encoding, management, and search to dedicated systems,
\item improved reliability of published results as the research community can more easily scrutinize the underlying data,
\item collaborations via shared datasets that are currently prohibitively expensive due to the difficulty of understanding other researchers' data, including collaborations across disciplines and with industry practitioners, who are currently excluded due to the difficulty of understanding the datasets,
\item reward mathematicians for sharing datasets (which is currently often not the case), e.g., by making datasets citable and their reuse known,
%\item It allows making the provenance of datasets more explicit.
\item more sustainable research by guaranteeing that datasets can be archived and their meaning understood in perpetuity (which is essential especially in mathematics).
\end{compactitem}

\paragraph{Contribution}
In this section we survey and systematize how mathematical data is represented and shared and analyze how it enables or prevents FAIR mathematics.
We pay particular attention to the mathematics-specific aspects of FAIR sharing, which, as we will observe, go significantly beyond the original formulation of FAIR.

As a first step towards a universal framework, and as a concrete example of FAIR-enabling mathematics-specific infrastructure, we introduce \dmh.
This is a platform for sharing relational mathematical datasets in a way that systematically enables FAIRness.
