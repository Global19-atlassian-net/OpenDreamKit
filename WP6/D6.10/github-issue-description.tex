The title of this deliverable was originally \emph{Full-text search (Formulae + Keywords) in OpenDreamKit}, but in the last grant proposal amendment the scope was broadened to a report on the remaining \WPref{dksbases} activities and achievements -- also to account for the new task \taskref{dksbases}{isabelle}. As the focus last reporting period was on integrating mathematical data, the title was changed to better account for this.

This report summarizes the achievements in Work Package 6 over the last year of the OpenDreamKit project\footnote{By oversight the title in the grant agreement has not been updated} Concretely, this report reports on the results of \tasktref{dksbases}{mws} and \tasktref{dksbases}{isabelle} and tasks \taskref{dksbases}{data-OEIS} to \taskref{dksbases}{data-LMFDB} (case studies in mathematical data sets).

In the last year of \pn, significant progress has been made in four areas:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the understanding of D/K/S-bases: we have codified the experiences in the OpenDreamKit project into a tetrapodal view on ``doing mathematics'', which extends the Data/Knowledge/Software model of the proposal by ``narration'' and ``organization'' aspects.
\item the Knowledge (K) aspect, where we have developed an exporter from library the Isabelle Theorem prover (Archive of Formal Proof) to an extensive RDF triple store, which can be queried by standard SPARQL queries for semantic search. \item the data (D) aspect, where we have
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item developed both an innovative model of (deep) FAIR in mathematics (and have integrated it with the MitM paradigm developed in OpenDreamKit),
  \item have implemented in a prototypical system (data.mathhub), and have
  \item evaluated it on the mathematical community outside the core OpenDreamKit community.
  \end{enumerate}
\item computational mathematical documents (the S aspect of D/K/S or the ``narration'' and ``computation'' aspects of the finer tetrapod model). Here we have developed a formula harvester for jupyter notebooks and a formula search engine that builds on them (as envisioned in task \taskref{dksbases}{mws}).
\end{enumerate}
