The design of OMDoc/MMT predates \pn, and we have reported on it previously \ednote{citations or OMDoc and of Sage/GAP exports}.
Therefore, we focus on the design of ULO here, which we report in Section~\ref{sec:ulo}.

Then, in Section~\ref{sec:isabelle}, we report on Task D6.10 \ednote{insert ref}, which exports the Isabelle knowledge base into OMDoc/MMT and ULO.
The latter includes the generation of ULO data from concrete libraries in RDF format.
The resulting dataset is massive, resulting in \ednote{insert omdoc size} $\approx 10^7$ RDF triples, requiring many CPU-hours to generate.
In parallel work, we have developed a similar export of the Coq library \ednote{cite our paper}, which we do not present in detail here.

Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:uloappl}, we demonstrate how to leverage these lightweight, high-level representations in practice.
As an example application, we set up a relational query engine based on Virtuoso.
It answers complex queries instantaneously, and even simple queries allow obtaining information that was previously impossible or expensive to extract.
Example queries include asking for all theorems of any library whose proof uses induction on $\mathbb{N}$,
%all theorems by a Michael Kohlhase or Makarius Wenzel, or 
%all theorems with incomplete Proofs,
or all authors of theorems ordered by how many of the proofs are incomplete,
%the average time it takes to check the proof assistant to check their theorems,
or all dependency paths through a particular library ordered by cumulative check time (which would enable optimized regression testing).
