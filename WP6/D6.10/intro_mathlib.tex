\subsection{Mathematical Libraries}\label{sec:mathlib}
% Innovations based on mathematical knowledge and algorithms yield many improvements in science, engineering, economy, ecology, health care, security, and society overall. 
% For example, our global positioning system (GPS) needs the mathematics of relativistic physics, our mobile phones use frequencies allocated through combinatorial optimization, the combinatorics of our genome yields clues to curing rare diseases, the privacy of our communications depends on cryptographic protocols steeped in number theory, and our national security is relying on the mathematical analysis of increasingly complex networks. 
% Fundamental mathematical research and its direct application in practical situations enable many engineering, science, and business innovations that enrich society and mankind.\ednote{FR: throw out this paragraph? Or replace with one sentence?}

% Modern mathematical research increasingly depends on collaborative tools, computational environments, and online databases, and these are changing the way mathematical research is conducted and how it is turned into applications.
% For example, engineers now use mathematical tools to build and simulate physical models based on systems of differential equations with millions of variables, combining building blocks and algorithms taken from libraries shared all over the internet.


For the the data (D) aspect of ``doing mathematics'' (see the \textbf{Tabulation} corner in Figure~\ref{fig:tetrapod}) we have
\begin{compactenum}
\item developed an both an innovative model of (deep) FAIR in mathematics (and have integrated it with the MitM paradigm developed in OpenDreamKit),
\item have implemented in a prototypical system (\dmh), and have
\item evaluated it on the mathematical community outside the core OpenDreamKit community.
\end{compactenum}

Traditionally, mathematics has not paid particular attention to the creation and sharing of data --- the careful computation and publication of logarithm tables is a typical example of the extent and method.
This has changed with the advent of computer-supported mathematics, and the practice of modern mathematics is increasingly data-driven.
Today it is routine to use mathematical datasets in the Gigabyte range, including both human-curated and machine-produced data.
Examples include the L-Functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB; $\sim 1$ TB data in number theory)~\cite{Cremona:LMFDB16,lmfdb:on} and the GAP Small Groups Library~\cite{GapSmallGroups:on} with $\sim 450$ million finite groups.  
In a few, but increasingly many areas, mathematics has even acquired traits of experimental sciences in that mathematical reality is ``measured'' at large scale by running computations.

There is wide agreement in mathematics that these datasets should be a common resource and be open and freely available.
Moreover, the software used to produce them is usually open source and free as well.
%While FAIR does not necessarily mean Open~\cite[2.3]{FAIR}, the appropriate Openness for almost all mathematical data is indeed open source and free.
Such an ecosystem is embraced by the mathematics community as a general vision for their future research infrastructure~\cite{NAS14}, adopted by the International Mathematical Union as the Global Digital Mathematics Library initiative \cite{GDML:on}.

To better understand the scale of the problem, Figure~\ref{fig:datasets} gives an overview of some state-of-the-art libraries.
Here we already use the division into four kinds of mathematical data that we will develop in Section~\ref{sec:deep}.

We present a uniform infrastructure for sharing, finding, and searching mathematical libraries of any kind.
Moreover, we seed this infrastructure with a collection of representative libraries (all of them state of the art and large) as described below.
