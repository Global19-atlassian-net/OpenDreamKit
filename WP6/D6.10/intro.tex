This report summarizes the achievements in Work Package 6 over the last year of the OpenDreamKit project\footnote{By oversight the title in the grant agreement has not been updated} Concretely, this report reports on the results of \tasktref{dksbases}{mws} and \tasktref{dksbases}{isabelle} and tasks \taskref{dksbases}{data-OEIS} to \taskref{dksbases}{data-LMFDB} (case studies in mathematical data sets).

In the last year, significant progress has been made in four areas, which we will introduce in the next subsections (\ref{sec:tetrapod} to \ref{subsec:software}) and then detail in the corresponding Sections~\ref{sec:knowledge} to \ref{sec:software}.

\begin{oldpart}{move to the subsections}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \item the Knowledge (K) aspect, where we have developed an exporter from library the Isabelle Theorem prover (Archive of Formal Proof) to an extensive RDF triple store, which can be queried by standard SPARQL queries for semantic search. \item the data (D) aspect, where we have
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item developed an both an innovative model of (deep) FAIR in mathematics (and have integrated it with the MitM paradigm developed in OpenDreamKit),
  \item have implemented in a prototypical system (data.mathhub), and have
  \item evaluated it on the mathematical community outside the core OpenDreamKit community.
  \end{enumerate}
\item computational mathematical documents (the S aspect of D/K/S or the "narration" and "computation" aspects of the finer tetrapod model). Here we have developed a formula harvester for Jupyter notebooks and a formula search engine that builds on them (as envisioned in task \taskref{dksbases}{mws}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Acknowledgments and Prior Dissemination}
Task D6.10 \ednote{insert task ref} was carried out as a subcontract by Makarius Wenzel.
Some parts of Section~\ref{sec:isabelle} are adapted from his descriptions of his work in the context of this subcontract.

This work has been published as \ednote{cite ULO paper} for ULO.\ednote{add other papers}
The export facilities of Isabelle and the integration with MMT have been integrated with Isabelle in its June 2019 release.
It was reported on in two blog posts by Wenzel%
\footnote{\url{https://sketis.net/2018/isabelle-mmt-export-of-isabelle-theories-and-import-as-omdoc-content}, and \url{https://sketis.net/2019/mmt-as-component-for-isabelle2019}}
and a paper is forthcoming.
