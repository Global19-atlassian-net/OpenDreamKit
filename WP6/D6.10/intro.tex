This report summarizes the achievements in Work Package 6 over the last year of the OpenDreamKit project\footnote{By oversight the title in the grant agreement has not been updated} Concretely, this report reports on the results of \tasktref{dksbases}{mws} and \tasktref{dksbases}{isabelle} and tasks \taskref{dksbases}{data-OEIS} to \taskref{dksbases}{data-LMFDB} (case studies in mathematical data sets). The work on persistent memoization in Python and GAP (see task \taskref{dksbases}{data-memo}) is excluded from this report because it has been reported on in \delivref{dksbases}{persistent-memoization}.

In the last year, significant progress has been made in four areas, which we will introduce in the next subsections (\ref{sec:tetrapod} to \ref{subsec:software}) and then detail the latter three in the corresponding Sections~\ref{sec:knowledge} to \ref{sec:software}.

\subsection{Acknowledgments and Prior Dissemination}
The tetrapod model sketched in Section~\ref{sec:tetrapod} was developed in close collaboration with Profs. William Farmer and Jacques Carette from McMaster University in Canada.
The latter is a member of the \pn advisory board. It has been pre-published in~\cite{CarFarKohRab:bmobb19}.

Task \taskref{dksbases}{isabelle} was carried out as a subcontract by Makarius Wenzel, the lead developer of the Isabelle system and the only person who could viably carry out the development due to the intimate system knowledge needed for the project.
Some parts of Section~\ref{sec:isabelle} are adapted from his descriptions of his work in the context of this subcontract.

The work reported in Section~\ref{sec:knowledge} has been published as \cite{ConKohMue:rdaml19} for ULO.
The export facilities of Isabelle and the integration with MMT have been integrated with Isabelle in its June 2019 release.
It was reported on in two blog posts by Wenzel%

and a paper is forthcoming.

The theoretical work reported in Section~\ref{sec:data} was submitted for publication as~\cite{CarFarKohRab:bmobb19}, while earlier work on the \dmh system (see Section~\ref{sec:data}) was reported in \cite{BerKohRab:tumdi19}.

The software engineering work on the MathWebSearch system from Section has not been published. The concrete application to searching Jupyter notebooks has been carried out together with Dr. Nicolas Thi\'erry.
