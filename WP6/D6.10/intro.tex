This report summarizes the achievements in Work Package 6 over the last year of the OpenDreamKit project\footnote{By oversight the title in the grant agreement has not been updated} Concretely, this report reports on the results of \tasktref{dksbases}{mws} and \tasktref{dksbases}{isabelle} and tasks \taskref{dksbases}{data-OEIS} to \taskref{dksbases}{data-LMFDB} (case studies in mathematical data sets).

In the last year, significant progress has been made in four areas, which we will introduce in the next subsections (\ref{sec:tetrapod} to \ref{subsec:software}) and then detail in the corresponding Sections~\ref{sec:knowledge} to \ref{sec:software}.

\begin{oldpart}{move to the subsections}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \item the Knowledge (K) aspect, where we have developed an exporter from library the Isabelle Theorem prover (Archive of Formal Proof) to an extensive RDF triple store, which can be queried by standard SPARQL queries for semantic search. \item the data (D) aspect, where we have
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item developed an both an innovative model of (deep) FAIR in mathematics (and have integrated it with the MitM paradigm developed in OpenDreamKit),
  \item have implemented in a prototypical system (data.mathhub), and have
  \item evaluated it on the mathematical community outside the core OpenDreamKit community.
  \end{enumerate}
\item computational mathematical documents (the S aspect of D/K/S or the "narration" and "computation" aspects of the finer tetrapod model). Here we have developed a formula harvester for jupyter notebooks and a formula search engine that builds on them (as envisioned in task \taskref{dksbases}{mws}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{oldpart}

\subsection{A new Model for Mathematical VREs}\label{sec:tetrapod}
The probably most fundamental progress for a mathematical research envieonment is a new understanding of the aspects of virtual research environments reached via the intensive work with the semantics of VREs in \WPref{dksbases}.  We have codified the experiences in the OpenDreamKit project into a tetrapodal view on ``doing
mathematics'' -- i.e. the activity to be supported by a VRE.

We propose that all mathematical VREs need to support the following four main aspects at scale:
\begin{compactenum}[\em i\rm)]
\item \textbf{Inference}: deriving statements by \emph{deduction} (i.e.,
  proving), \emph{abduction} (i.e., conjecture formation from best
  explanations), and \emph{induction} (i.e., conjecture formation from examples).
\item \textbf{Computation}: algorithmic manipulation and simplification
  of mathematical expressions and other representations of
  mathematical objects.
\item \textbf{Tabulation}: generating, collecting, maintaining, and accessing
  collections of examples that suggest patterns and relations and allow testing
  of conjectures. 
\item \textbf{Narration}: bringing the results into a form that can be digested by humans,
  usually in mathematical documents like articles, books, or preprints, that expose the
  ideas in natural language but also in diagrams, tables, and simulations.
\end{compactenum} 
Computer support exists for all of these four aspects of Big Math, e.g.,
\begin{compactenum}[\em i\rm)]
\item theorem provers like Isabelle, Coq, or Mizar;
\item computer algebra systems like GAP, SageMath, Maple, or Mathematica; and
\item mathematical data bases like the L-functions and Modular Forms Data 
Base (LMFDB)~\cite{Cremona:LMFDB16,lmfdb:on} and the Online Encyclopedia of
Integer Sequences (OEIS)~\cite{Sloane:OEIS};
\item online journals, mathematical information systems like zbMATH or MathSciNet,
  preprint servers like arXiv.org, or research-level help systems like MathOverflow.
\end{compactenum}
Humans can easily integrate these four aspects and do that for all mathematical developments, the corresponding integration in software systems is still a significant problem. It is our experience from the \pn project that one of the prerequisites is a \textbf{modular organization} of all four aspects in terms of a joint \textbf{mathematical ontology} -- the Math-in-the-Middle (MitM) ontology introduced in \WPref{dksbases} of the \pn project.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:tetrapod} organizes these four aspects into a tetrapodal structure with the MitM ontology.  This model extends and refines he Data/Knowledge/Software model of the proposal by ``narration'' and ``organization'' aspects. \ednote{MK: talk more about tetrapod here}

\subsection{Mathematical Libraries}\label{sec:mathlib}
% Innovations based on mathematical knowledge and algorithms yield many improvements in science, engineering, economy, ecology, health care, security, and society overall. 
% For example, our global positioning system (GPS) needs the mathematics of relativistic physics, our mobile phones use frequencies allocated through combinatorial optimization, the combinatorics of our genome yields clues to curing rare diseases, the privacy of our communications depends on cryptographic protocols steeped in number theory, and our national security is relying on the mathematical analysis of increasingly complex networks. 
% Fundamental mathematical research and its direct application in practical situations enable many engineering, science, and business innovations that enrich society and mankind.\ednote{FR: throw out this paragraph? Or replace with one sentence?}

Modern mathematical research increasingly depends on collaborative tools, computational environments, and online databases, and these are changing the way mathematical research is conducted and how it is turned into applications.
For example, engineers now use mathematical tools to build and simulate physical models based on systems of differential equations with millions of variables, combining building blocks and algorithms taken from libraries shared all over the internet.

Traditionally, mathematics has not paid particular attention to the creation and sharing of data --- the careful computation and publication of logarithm tables is a typical example of the extent and method.
This has changed with the advent of computer-supported mathematics, and the practice of modern mathematics is increasingly data-driven.
Today it is routine to use mathematical datasets in the Gigabyte range, including both human-curated and machine-produced data.
Examples include the L-Functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB; $\sim 1$ TB data in number theory)~\cite{Cremona:LMFDB16,lmfdb:on} and the GAP Small Groups Library~\cite{GapSmallGroups:on} with $\sim 450$ million finite groups.  
In a few, but increasingly many areas, mathematics has even acquired traits of experimental sciences in that mathematical reality is ``measured'' at large scale by running computations.

There is wide agreement in mathematics that these datasets should be a common resource and be open and freely available.
Moreover, the software used to produce them is usually open source and free as well.
%While FAIR does not necessarily mean Open~\cite[2.3]{FAIR}, the appropriate Openness for almost all mathematical data is indeed open source and free.
Such an ecosystem is embraced by the mathematics community as a general vision for their future research infrastructure~\cite{NAS14}, adopted by the International Mathematical Union as the Global Digital Mathematics Library initiative \cite{GDML:on}.

To better understand the scale of the problem, Figure~\ref{fig:datasets} gives an overview over some state-of-the-art libraries.
Here we already use the division into four kinds of mathematical data that we will develop in Section~\ref{sec:fair}.

\ednote{add the collection used for the jupyter notebooks to the table}

We present a uniform infrastructure for sharing, finding, and searching mathematical libraries of any kind.
Moreover, we seed this infrastructure with a collection of representative libraries (all of them state of the art and large) as described below.

\subsection{Formal Knowledge Bases}\label{sec:isabelle}
For many decades, the development of a universal database of all mathematical knowledge, as envisioned, e.g., in the QED manifesto \cite{qed}, has been a major driving force of computer mathematics.
Today a variety of such libraries are available.
These are most prominently developed in proof assistants such as Coq \cite{coq} or Isabelle \cite{isabelle} and are treasure troves of detailed mathematical knowledge.
However, despite the enormous potential for many applications of and in virtual research environments, this treasure is usually locked into system- and logic-specific representations that can only be understood by the respective theorem prover system.
For example, this precludes applications such as finding related object in knowledge bases from within computation-oriented systems as used in OpenDreamKit.

Therefore, we have developed interface standards that allow maintainers of formal libraries to make their content available to outside systems.
In this deliverable, we report on complementing our existing OMDoc/MMT standard for representing entire knowledge bases with a new Upper Library Ontology (ULO).
ULO is a standard ontology for exchanging high-level information about mathematical libraries that systematically abstracts all symbolic knowledge away and only retain what can be easily represented relationally.
That allows for semantic web-style representations, for which simple and standardized formalisms such as OWL2 \cite{w3c:owl2-xml}, RDF \cite{rdf}, and SPARQL~\cite{w3c:SPARQL-Rec:13} as well as highly scalable tools are readily available.
While it is well-known that ontology language--based relational formalisms are inappropriate for symbolic knowledge like formulas, algorithms, and proofs, it is this high-level information that is often critical important for integration into virtual research environments, e.g., to realize benefits like search.

We report on this in Section~\ref{sec:knowledge}.
The bulk of this section is taken by a report on a new task (D6.11) \ednote{maybe insert taskref} that we have added to \pn.
In this task, we export the large Isabelle knowledge bases \ednote{insert size estimate} as both OMDoc/MMT and ULO format.
We show the utility of the generated ULO data by setting up a relational query engine that provides easy access to certain library information that was previously hard or impossible to determine.

\paragraph{Relational Datasets}
Many mathematical datasets take the form of large SQL/CSV--style datasets that enumerate all or a selection of interesting objects satisfying certain properties, e.g., all finite groups up to a certain size.
These can be produced in bulk or grow from individual user submissions.

They are generally produced, published, and maintained with virtually no systematic attention to the FAIR principles~\cite{FAIR,WilDumAal:FAIR16} for making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.
In fact, often the sharing of data is an afterthought --- see~\cite{Bercic:cmo:wiki} for an overview of mathematical datasets and their ``FAIR-readiness''.

Moreover, the inherent complexity of mathematical data makes it very difficult to share in practice: even freely accessible datasets are often very hard or impossible to reuse, let alone make machine-interoperable because there is no systematic way of specifying the relation between the raw data and its mathematical meaning. 
Therefore, unfortunately FAIR mathematical datasets essentially do not exist today.
