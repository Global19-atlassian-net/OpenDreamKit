This report summarizes the achievements in Work Package 6 over the last year of the OpenDreamKit project\footnote{By oversight the title in the grant agreement has not been updated} Concretely, this report reports on the results of \tasktref{dksbases}{mws} and \tasktref{dksbases}{isabelle} and tasks \taskref{dksbases}{data-OEIS} to \taskref{dksbases}{data-LMFDB} (case studies in mathematical data sets).

In the last year, significant progress has been made in four areas, which we will introduce in the next subsections (\ref{sec:tetrapod} to \ref{subsec:software}) and then detail the latter three in the corresponding Sections~\ref{sec:knowledge} to \ref{sec:software}.

\subsection{Acknowledgments and Prior Dissemination}
Task D6.10 \ednote{insert task ref} was carried out as a subcontract by Makarius Wenzel.
Some parts of Section~\ref{sec:isabelle} are adapted from his descriptions of his work in the context of this subcontract.

This work has been published as \ednote{cite ULO paper} for ULO.\ednote{add other papers}
The export facilities of Isabelle and the integration with MMT have been integrated with Isabelle in its June 2019 release.
It was reported on in two blog posts by Wenzel%
\footnote{\url{https://sketis.net/2018/isabelle-mmt-export-of-isabelle-theories-and-import-as-omdoc-content}, and \url{https://sketis.net/2019/mmt-as-component-for-isabelle2019}}
and a paper is forthcoming.
