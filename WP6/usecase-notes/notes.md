# Some notes for use-cases 

In this file I (Markus Pfeiffer) collect use-cases for Maths-in-the-middle that I get from users.
Where possible I will give credit so that we can follow up with particular people.

This could be used as a starting point for a Zoo of use-cases. Feel free to add things
either in this file, or separate files.

 * Alla Detinko has algorithms for computing with matrix groups over infinite domains
   (motivated by real problems in topology) which require serious number theory,
   Groebner basis and matrix group recognition (over finite quotient fields).

 * There are algorithms for computing 2x2 and 3x3 matrix images of finitely presented
   groups that use Gr√∂bner Bases. (So we define a FP group in GAP and want
   a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix group, call out to singular to compute the GB).
   (This was suggested by Steve Linton)

 * Computing Galois Groups seems to be a hard problem. I will be visitng
   Bordeaux next January to work with the Pari/GP people to integrate
   Pari and GAP for this purpose.
