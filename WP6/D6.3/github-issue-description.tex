The OpenDreamKit proposal had envisioned WP6:
\emph{Data/Knowledge/Software bases} as a foundational enterprise that
would develop a knowledge-based architecture over the course of the
project and would allow to re-engineer \emph{ad-hoc} interfaces between
systems (e.g.~from T3.2
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/51}{\#51}))
on a more \emph{semantic} basis -- the knowledge aspect (K).
Consequently, the proposal envisioned concentrating the data (D) aspect
on the mathematical knowledge bases (specifically LMFDB, OEIS, and
FindStat) and proposed a host of foundational investigations of
mathematical for the software (S) aspect with applications e.g.~in the
verification of algorithms.

Already the kickoff meeting in Paris in September 2015 revealed that the
D/K/S aspects are much more tightly coupled in systems than anticipated.
This was confirmed by the DKS survey conducted subsequently (see Section
2 of D6.2
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/136}{\#136})).
In particular, the participants of WP6 identified the interoperability
of OpenDreamKit systems to be one of the most critical steps in creating
a VRE toolkit. Thus we prioritized tasks T6.1
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/123}{\#123}),
T6.2
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/124}{\#124}),
T6.3
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/125}{\#125})
and organized a series of workshops and code-maratons to develop a
semantic foundation for system interoperability and simultaneously test
it in implementations.

As a consequence, we have completed the initial design of D/K/S-bases
(for D6.2
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/136}{\#136}))
in parallel with the initial implementation of a DKS base format based
on OMDoc/MMT and the implementation of a DKS base system itself based on
the MMT system (both for D6.3
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/137}{\#137})),
all activities fuelling each other. D6.3
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/137}{\#137})
was thus completed about three months ahead of schedule. Note that the
RNC schema envisioned in the title proved un-necessary since, with the
refined Math-in-the-Middle (MitM) design, the normal OMDoc/MMT schema is
sufficient.

Due to the resulting tight coupling between D6.2
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/136}{\#136})
and D6.3
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/137}{\#137}),
and for the convenience of the reader, we have decided to report on both
deliverables together; see the report for deliverable D6.2
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/136}{\#136}).
When the design has further matured through work in the OpenDreamKit
project, we plan to describe the MitM paradigm of integration of
mathematical software systems into a VRE toolkit in a journal paper. We
envision submission around month 27.
