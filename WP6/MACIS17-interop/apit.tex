\subsection{GAP API Content Dictionaries}
\ednote{MK@MP+DM: describe the GAP API theory and how they are generated; give the numbers, but only give the diffs to the CICM16 paper.}

In \cite{DehKohKon:iop16} we describe our approach to export knowledge in the
form of type information from the GAP system and produce a full GAP API CD.

We defined the primitives of GAP's type system in OMDoc/MMT, and it is
subject to future investigation whether MMT can serve as an external typechecker
for GAP.

GAP's type system is based on sub-typing: \emph{Filters} express finer and finer
subtypes of the universal \emph{IsObject}. An object in GAP can learn about its
properties, meaning its type is refined: A group can learn that it is abelian or
nilpotent and hence its type changes.

For a successful implementation of an MitM system it is necessary to know how
a given object in an ongoing session has been created. Formally objects are
created by applying a \emph{constructor} to a list of arguments which are
themselves objects.
Since GAP has only a weak notion of object construction, we achieve this by
identifying functions that create objects, and then instrumenting them to store
the relevant arguments they were called with.
The instrumentation itself is minimal (57 lines of GAP code, plus 100 lines for
printing objects as OpenMath). The main challenge was
to identify functions that construct objects, and which arguments of those
functions are then stored in the object.
In GAP objects are created by calling the function \texttt{Objectify} with a
type and some data, hence all that was needed was an analysis of call-sites to
this function and some light inference of the enclosing function.
Developing the instrumentation lead to many improvements of type-handling
infrastructure in GAP itself, and the instrumentation will be integrated into a
future version of GAP, making GAP fully MitM capable.
\ednote{@MP think about
  ``why not just'' using the arguments to Objectify, this would of course also
  be stored, but looks even more minimal}

In the GAP library there are 665 calls to Objectify, and in the standard package
distribution there are an additional 1664.

With the constructor annotation in place it is possible to have GAP represent
any object in a running session as either a primitive type (integers,
permutations, transformations, lists, floats, strings), for which standard
OpenMath CDs are used, or a constructor applied to a list of arguments. This
lends itself perfectly to a representation in the GAP API CD.

\ednote{MP: Put an example of OM\_Print here, maybe for a group, or for Cosets
  (as they are something that the standard OpenMath CDs in GAP cannot do)}

\ednote{MK@MP: we also need to talk about the OM Phrasebook (see
  Section~\ref{sec:mitm}), and how that works. Actually I think that this is
  really the new part we want to discuss here.}

\subsection{SageMath API Content Dictionaries}
\ednote{MK@NT: please write something here, this can be a bit more elaborate
than the GAP part above, since GAP has already been described in the CICM16
paper. What is the state of the OM Phrasebook for SageMath?}

\subsection{Creation Of Singular API CDs}
\ednote{MK: it would be great, if we could do this and als have an estimation of
the time used for this.}

For Singular we used standard OpenMath CDs for polynomials and wrapped
\texttt{Singular} in a thin layer of python code that provides SCSCP
communication. This work was undertaken by the sixth author as part of a summer
nternship in about a week without prior expert
knowledge of the system.\ednote{MP@MK What is the correct way of phrasing this?}
