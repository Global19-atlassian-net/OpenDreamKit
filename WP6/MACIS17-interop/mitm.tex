\section{The MitM Paradigm}\label{sec:mitm}

To build a VRE toolkit from open-source (or open-API\footnote{It turns out that it is
  sufficient to have a well-documented API that gives access to the internal
  (mathematical) data structures and functionality, so closed-source systems can also be
  part of the MitM paradigm if they do.}) systems, we need a joint user interface -- the
OpenDreamKit project adopts Jupyter~\cite{jupyter-project:on} and active
documents~\cite{KohDavGin:psewads11} -- and an interoperability layer that allows to pass
problems and results between the disparate systems.

\begin{todolist}{MK@MK: recap from CICM paper}
\item copy the running example from Tom's thesis as a didactically motivated example:
  three-party computation, mathematically somewhat trivial, but informative; and it
  involves SageMath
\item introduce the GAP/Singular case study as a running example and make it concrete in
  the MitM paradigm -- this example is mathematically
