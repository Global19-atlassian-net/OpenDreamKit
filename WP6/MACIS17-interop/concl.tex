\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}
\begin{todolist}{MK@MK: summary}
\item what is the ``business model'' for the general MitM-based cooperation model?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item talk about ``singular and \GAP work in SAGE today'', but ad-hoc and non-scalable 
  \item MitM makes alignments that are at the basis of interoperability star-shaped and
    thus scalable.
  \item investment: small network joining costs in the size of the system, rewards:
    network effect in the size of the network. I.e. we do not need quadratically many
    programmers
  \item talk about compiling $n^2$ s2s translations from the MitM alignments. 
  \end{itemize}
\item how can YOU help extend the MitM?
