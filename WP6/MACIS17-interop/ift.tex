\section{Interface Theories for GAP and SageMath}\label{sec:ift}
\begin{todolist}{MK: some of this has already been discussed in the CICM16 paper, }
\item MK@MP+DM: describe the GAP interface theory and how they are generated; give the
numbers, but only give the diffs to the CICM16 paper.
\item MK@NT+DM: describe the SageMath interface theory and how it is generated; this is
  new. 
\item MK@MK+NT+MP: compare and discuss the different generation approaches\ednote{MK: do
    we have a IFT for Singular yet?}
\item MK@MK: conclude the section by a discussion about OpenMath and Dialects.
