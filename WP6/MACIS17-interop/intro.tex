\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

There is a large and vibrant ecosystem of open-source mathematical software systems. 
These systems can range from calculators, which are only capable of performing simple computations, via mathematical databases (curating collections of a mathematical objects), to powerful modeling tools and computer algebra systems (CAS).

Most of these systems are very specific -- they focus on one or very few aspects of mathematics. 
For example, the ``Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences'' (OEIS~\cite{Sloane:oeis12,oeis}) focuses on sequences over $\mathbb{Z}$ an their properties and the ``L-Functions and Modular Forms Database'' (LMFDB)~\cite{Cremona:LMFDB16,lmfdb:on} objects in number theory pertaining to Langland's program. 
GAP~\cite{GAP:on} excels at discrete algebra, whereas SageMath~\cite{SageMath:on} focuses on Algebra and Geometry in general, and Singular~\cite{singular:on} on polynomial computations, with special emphasis on commutative and non-commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and singularity theory.

For a mathematician however (a user; let us call her Jane) the systems themselves are not relevant, instead she only cares about being able to solve problems. 
Typically, it is not possible to solve a mathematical problem using only a single program. 
Thus Jane needs to work with multiple systems and combine the results to reach a solution. 
Currently there is very little help with this practice, so Jane has to isolate sub-problems the respective systems are amenable to, formulate them into the respective input language, collect results, and reformulate them for the next system --- a tedious and error-prone process at best, a significant impediment to scientific progress in its overall effect. 
Solutions for some situations certainly exist, which can help get Jane unstuck, but these are ad-hoc and for specific, often-used system combinations only. 
Each of these requires a lot of maintenance and does not scale to a larger set of specialist systems. 

The OpenDreamKit project, which aims at a mathematical VRE toolkit, proposes the Math-in-the-Middle (MitM~\cite{DehKohKon:iop16}) Paradigm, an interoperability framework based on a flexiformal
representation of mathematical knowledge and aligns this with system-generated interface theories. 

In this paper we instantiate the MitM paradigm with a concrete domain development and evaluate it on a distributed computing GAP, SageMath and Singular.\ednote{ we generally we
  want to show that the promises in the CICM paper become reality.}

We will use the following example as a running example: Jane wants to act on singular polynomials with GAP permutation groups\ednote{MK@(MP|VA): }
\ednote{MP: We might not be that far away from computing with Singular \emph{polynomial ideals}, which is a really interesting usecase}
