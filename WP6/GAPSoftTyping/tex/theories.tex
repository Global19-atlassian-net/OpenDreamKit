%\paragraph{A Logic for GAP Theories}
%We can identify a logic and a group of theories that can be naturally embedded into GAP's type system.
%
%Any GAP filter can be used as a type.
%
%Every theory implicitly declares a fixed base type $u$ for the universe.
%
%Then it may have two kinds of declarations:
% \begin{compactitem}
%   \item includes of another theory,
%   \item function symbols $f:a_1\times\ldots\times a_n\to a_0$ where each $a_i$ is a type (either $u$ or some GAP type),
%   \item potential axioms: code in GAP's underlying programming language that evaluates to a boolean
% \end{compactitem}

\paragraph{Theories and Types of Models}
Categories can be used to represent the type of models of a logical theory.
Consider a theory of sorted first-order logic with name $T$ that includes theories $T_1,\ldots,T_k$, declares declares function symbols $f_i:A_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,l$, and declares axioms $p_i$ asserting $F_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,m$.

We can represent this in GAP using the following declarations:
\begin{compactitem}
 \item a category with name $T$ and superfilter $T_1\wedge \ldots \wedge T_n$,
 \item for every $f_i:A_i$ with $A_i=a_1\times\ldots\times a_n\to a$, an $n+1$-ary operation $f_i$ with input filters $T,a_1,\ldots,a_n$ and output filter $a$,
 \item for every $p_i$, a property with input filter $T$,
 \item for every $p_i$, a method implementing $F_i$ (which may be impossible or only possible for restricted case, e.g., only for finite models).
\end{compactitem}

Now the filter $T\wedge p_1\wedge\ldots\wedge p_m$ represents the type of models of the theory.

A concrete model of the theory is represented as follows: \ednote{unclear how to do that}

%\paragraph{Extracting Explicit Theories from GAP's}
%Because GAP does not enforce an abstraction boundary between theories and types, it is not generally feasible to extract explicit theories from GAP.
%
%A heuristic extraction might be possible by trying to identity groups of GAP declarations for which the above operation can be inverted to yield a theory.
