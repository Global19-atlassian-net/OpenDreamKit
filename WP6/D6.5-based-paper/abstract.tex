There is a large ecosystem of mathematical software systems and knowledge bases.
Individually, these are optimized for particular domains and functionalities, and together they cover many needs of practical and theoretical mathematics.
However, each system specializes on one particular area, and it remains very difficult to solve problems that need to involve multiple systems.
Some integrations exist, but they are ad-hoc and have scalability and maintainability issues.
In particular, there is not yet an interoperability layer that combines the various systems into a virtual research environment (VRE) for mathematics.
  
The OpenDreamKit project aims at building a toolkit for such VREs.
It suggests using a central system-agnostic formalization of mathematics (Math-in-the-Middle, MitM) as a mathematical pivot point for semantic-preserving translations in the needed interoperability layer.
In this \papertype, we report on a series of case studies that instantiates the MitM paradigm with the systems \GAP, \Sage, \LMFDB, and \Singular to perform distributed computation in group, ring, and number theory.
 
Our work involves massive practical efforts, including a novel formalization of computational group theory, improvements and extensions of the involved software systems and knowledge bases, an extension of the underlying knowledge management system to cope with large theories, and a novel mediating system that sits at the center of a star-shaped integration layout between mathematical software systems and knowledge bases.

Together with deliverable report \textbf{D6.8}, this report describes the implementation and initial evaluation of the MitM integration and interoperability paradigm initially envisioned in deliverables \textbf{D6.2} and \textbf{D6.3}.
The MitM paradigm constitutes the core development goal of \textbf{WP6} and the curated content described in this report enables running non-trivial integrations.
In the future we expect further extending the reach of the integration in terms of both systems covered as well as knowledge available in the central MitM ontology.
