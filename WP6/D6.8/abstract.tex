Work Package \textbf{WP6} develops a novel, foundational, knowledge-based framework for interfacing existing open source mathematical software systems and knowledge bases into a mathematical VRE, where systems can delegate functionalities among each other seamlessly without losing semantics.

The overall Math-in-the-Middle (MitM) Framework developed in \textbf{WP6} over the last three years is described in \textbf{D6.5}; this Report complements it by describing the curated contents Math-in-the-Middle (MitM) Ontology which serves as a reference and pivotal point for translations between the various input languages of mathematical software systems and knowledge bases.

In a nutshell, the MitM Ontology describes the mathematical objects, concepts, and their relations in a general, system-agnostic way in an OMDoc/MMT theory graph while the mathematical systems export API theories that describe the system interface language in terms of types, classes, constructors, and functions -- again in OMDoc/MMT.
These two levels of descriptions are linked by OMDoc/MMT alignments that allow the translation of expressions between systems.

Together with deliverable report \textbf{D6.5}, this report describes the implementation and initial evaluation of the MitM integration and interoperability paradigm initially envisioned in deliverables \textbf{D6.2} and \textbf{D6.3}. The MitM paradigm constitutes the core development goal of \textbf{WP6} and the curated content described in this report enables running non-trivial integration case studies. In the future we hope to further consolidate content, increase coverage of alignment, and greatly extend the reach of the integration both in terms of OpenDreamKit systems covered as well as knowledge available in the MitM Core ontology.
