  Work Package WP6 develops a novel, foundational, knowledge-based framework for
  interfacing existing open source mathematical software systems and knowledge bases into
  a mathematical VRE, where systems can delegate functionalities among each other
  seamlessly without losing semantics.

  The overall Math-in-the-Middle (MitM) Framework developed in WP6 over the last three
  years is described in D6.5; this Report complements it by describing the curated
  contents Math-in-the-Middle (MitM) Ontology which serves as a reference and pivotal
  point for translations between the various input languages of mathematical software
  systems and knowledge bases.

  In a nutshell, the MitM Ontology describes the mathematical objects, concepts, and their
  relations in a general, system-agnostic way in an OMDoc/MMT theory graph while the
  mathematical systems export API theories that describe the system interface language in
  terms of types, classes, constructors, and functions -- again in OMDoc/MMT. These two
  levels of descriptions are linked by OMDoc/MMT alignments that allow the translation of
  expressions between systems.
