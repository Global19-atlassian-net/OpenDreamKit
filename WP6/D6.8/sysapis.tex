\subsection{Generated System API Theories}\label{sec:sysapis:gentheories}

We have generated and cross-linked system APIs for the computer algebra systems GAP,
SageMath, and SINGUALAR, they can be found at
\url{https://gl.mathhub.info/ODK/{GAP,SAGE,SINGULAR,LMFDB,knowls}}.\ednote{MK: write some more}

\subsection{The MitM Alignments}

The MitM alignments are available from \url{https://gl.mathhub.info/alignments/Public} (6
files, 1040 LoF, 240 Commits). They are represented as text files containing pairs of MMT
URIs annotated with various semantic classification schemata;
see~\cite{MueGauKal:cacfms17} for details.\ednote{MK: what else can we write about them?}
\ednote{this figure does not fit in the text width}

As an example, Figure~\ref{fig:cgtontology} sketches the alignments between the
computational group theory ontology from above and the constructors and operations of
\GAP.
