\section{Outlook and Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this report we introduced the basics of how we imagine \MMT data-centric theories. Here
we connect to external databases which we model as a set of well-typed records, that is
list of (key, value) pairs. We introduced the concept of record types inside \MMT. Here
keys are symbols which are declared inside a schema theory and the values are \MMT
literals translated from the physical database representations using codecs.

Additionally we have implemented an actual example. For this we used the LMFDB database of
elliptic curves. We implemented a multitude of codecs that should also prove useful in
future expansions of this implementation. We have demonstrated that it is possible to
integrate databases inside \MMT seamlessly so that it is not noticeable that declarations
are actually retrieved from a database instead of being declared from within \MMT
directly.

In the future we want to expand on this concept. Right now we can only translate database
records into \MMT objects. While we want to use the form of the objects used by \MMT as
the primary representation we want to be able to translate these objects to system specific
objects. Each system might have system-specific constructors and / or representations. In
practice all systems will have a constructor for these objects. These will take a set of
arguments. These arguments will either be primitive (in which case we can just encode them
from \MMT using a codec) or be complex objects themselves (in which case we can recurse
into the entire procedure). Storing these encodings inside \MMT we will be able to write
thin interfaces to \MMT, which can then easily retrieve objects from \MMT in their
preferred representation.

Together with the opposite process -- the understanding of objects by using accessors from
arbitrary systems -- will also allow (almost) arbitrary systems to exchange objects via
\MMT. We are already working on a \python Client implementation. This will not apply any
recoding to the objects -- it just retrieves records in an easily accessible form from
\MMT. In the future we are hoping to use this to integrate \MMT and \GAP and enable \GAP
to use any kind of object that \MMT has access to.
