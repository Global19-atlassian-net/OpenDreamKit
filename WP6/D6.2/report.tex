\begin{abstract}
  \emph{NOTE: The participants of \WPref{dksbases} identified the interoperability of \pn
    systems to be one of the most critical steps in creating a VRE toolkit and
    consequently prioritized tasks \taskref{dksbases}{data-assessment},
    \taskref{dksbases}{data-triform}, \taskref{dksbases}{data-design} and organized a
    series of workshops and code-maratons to develop a semantic foundation for system
    interoperability and simultaneously test it in implementations.}  

  \emph{As a consequence, we have completed an initial design of \DKS-bases (for
    deliverable \delivref{dksbases}{design}) and at the same an initial implementation of
    a \DKS base format based on OMDoc/MMT and an implementation based on the \MMT system
    (both for \delivref{dksbases}{dkstheories}; these results are three months ahead of
    schedule).}

  \emph{This report reports on both deliverables together, since the presentation is
    highly interconnected. We will label the text parts by the deliverable they contribute
    to mainly.}

  To build Virtual Research environments (VREs) we need to integrate three different
  aspects, Data (D), Knowledge (K), and Software (S). We want to achieve this by extending
  the well-established framework of OMDoc/MMT theory graphs, which focuses on knowledge,
  with support for software and data.

  In this report we present the design process towards \DKS-theories including the overall
  architecture (for \delivref{dksbases}{design}), a survey of the systems involved (for
  \delivref{dksbases}{dkstheories}), our current implementation (for
  \delivref{dksbases}{dkstheories}) as well as our plans for the future.
