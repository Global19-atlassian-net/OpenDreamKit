We use JSON as the target format of our encodings.
The most obvious alternative would have been XML.

Both JSON and XML are untyped and provide basic structuring features like lists and records.
Moreover, both are easy to parse and serialize, and libraries exist for most programming languages.

JSON has the advantage that it is simpler (e.g., avoiding namespace issues) and has a more human-readable concrete syntax\footnote{This is important for practitioners, which often do not have the time to learn the abstract syntax and depend on an immediately-understandable concrete syntax.}
It is also helpful that it explicitly distinguishes booleans, integers, and strings.
