\section{Preamble}
While this report nominally concerns work conducted at the University of Zurich on \ODK between September 1st 2015 and January 31st 2018, the University of Zurich has only ever employed Paul-Olivier Dehaye to work on \ODK, as had been planned. In addition, that work period only extended until July 31st 2017, at which time Dehaye left the University of Zurich. This report thus covers that period specifically, since no scientific work was conducted in Zurich on \ODK since.

In order to assist the reader, it might helpful to state that Zurich was only involved in one Work Package in \ODK, beyond Work Package 1 (administration). 

\section{Explanation of the work carried out by the beneficiaries and Overview of the progress}

%•	Explain the work carried out during the reporting period in line with the Annex 1 to the Grant Agreement. 
%•	Include an overview of the project results towards the objective of the action in line with the structure of the Annex 1 to the Grant Agreement including summary of deliverables and milestones, and a summary of exploitable results and an explanation about how they can/will be exploited.
%(No page limit per workpackage but report shall be concise and readable. Any duplication should be avoided).

  \section{Deviations from Annex 1 and Annex 2 (if applicable)}
  % Explain the reasons for deviations from the DoA, the consequences and the proposed
  % corrective actions
Since Dehaye/Zurich effectively left at M23, there is little sense in discussing the state of deliverables here. 

It is clear however that many changes were enacted following the first review at M18, and that Dehaye was involved through WP1 in the preparation of those. 

  Specifically in \WPref{dksbases} ,  some titles of the deliverables were modified to respect the change in
  priority on system interoperability and distributed computing in the
  ``Math-in-the-Middle'' Paradigm over algorithm verification:
  \longdelivref{dksbases}{psfoundation}, \longdelivref{dksbases}{pssem}, and
  \longdelivref{dksbases}{lfmverif}

  \subsection{Tasks}

As above, there is little sense in discussing here the state of tasks as left off at M23. 
% Include explanations for tasks not fully implemented, critical objectives not fully
  % achieved and/or not being on schedule.  Explain also the impact on other tasks on the
  % available \ref{?}sources and the planning

  \subsubsection{Unforeseen use of in kind contribution from third party against payment or
    free of charges (if applicable)}
