Zurich had initially planned:
\begin{itemize}
\item 12 PM on WP6 (starting at M13);
\item 1PM on WP1;
\item other direct costs: EUR 32800.
\end{itemize}
with the understanding that from M1-M12 Dehaye would work part-time on \ODK, while covered by another source of funding.

In the end, we realized the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item 10.5 PM on WP6;
\item 0.5PM on WP1;
\item other direct costs: EUR 3044.59, covering some \ODK trips and one laptop.
\end{itemize}
and indeed Dehaye was working part-time M1-M12 on \ODK, while covered by another source of funding. 

The change was due to initial mistakes in the budgeting, underestimating social charges and the salary required by UZH internal rules, given that Dehaye had already been employed at UZH for a few years. This was fixed by spending some of the direct costs into PMs, and compressing over 11PM total what had been planned over 13PM (this is of course in addition to M1-M12, which were covered by UZH). This change had no impact on scientific output and deliverables.
