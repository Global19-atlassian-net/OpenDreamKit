  \subsection{Use of resources}
  % Include explanations on deviations of the use of resources between actual and planned
  % use of resources in Annex 1, especially related to person-months per work package.

All changes of use of resources were included in the two amendments previously cited and were
due to modifications in the personnel. Those adjustments were due to the change of positions
of some key \ODK participants and expected difficulties in hiring planned
staff. The work plan has been updated accordingly, with no foreseeable
impact on the achievement of tasks, deliverables, and milestones.
