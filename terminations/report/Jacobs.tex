\section{Deviations from Annex 1 and Annex 2 (if applicable)}
  % Explain the reasons for deviations from the DoA, the consequences and the proposed
  % corrective actions

There was no major deviation from Annex 1. All deliverables due for M18 were delivered
  within the timeframe of the 1st Reporting Period, and all milestones in this period were
  reached.  Slight modifications were brought to \WPref{hpc} and \WPref{dksbases} and were
  included in the AMD-676541-13.


  Some deliverables names in \WPref{hpc} were modified
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \delivref{hpc}{MPIRsuperoptimiser} from "Extend the existing assembly
    superoptimiser for AVX and upcoming Intel processor extensions for the MPIR library"
    to "Write an assembly superoptimiser supporting AVX and upcoming Intel processor
    extensions for the MPIR library and optimise MPIR for modern processors"
  \item \delivref{hpc}{QS-linalg} from"Parallelise the relation sieving component of the
    Quadratic Sieve and implement a parallel version of Block-Wiederman linear algebra
    over GF2 and the triple large prime variant" to "Parallelise the relation sieving
    component of the Quadratic Sieve and implement a parallel version of Block-Wiederman
    linear algebra over GF2 and implement large prime variants"
  \item \delivref{hpc}{FFT} from "Take advantage of multiple cores in the matrix Fourier
    Algorithm component of the FFT for integer and polynomial arithmetic, and include
    assembly primitives for SIMD processor instructions (AVX, Knight's Bridge, etc.),
    especially in the FFT butterflies" to "Take advantage of multiple cores in the matrix
    Fourier Algorithm component of the FFT for integer and polynomial arithmetic, and
    include assembly primitives for SIMD processor instructions (e.g. AVX, etc.),
    especially in the FFT butterflies"
  \end{enumerate}

  Some titles of the \WPref{dksbases} deliverables were modified to respect the change in
  priority on system interoperability and distributed computing in the
  ``Math-in-the-Middle'' Paradigm over algorithm verification:
  \longdelivref{dksbases}{psfoundation}, \longdelivref{dksbases}{pssem}, and
  \longdelivref{dksbases}{lfmverif}

  \subsection{Tasks}

No deviation from the tasks. All workplan is on time at the end of the Reporting Period.
% Include explanations for tasks not fully implemented, critical objectives not fully
  % achieved and/or not being on schedule.  Explain also the impact on other tasks on the
  % available resources and the planning

  \subsection{Use of resources}
  % Include explanations on deviations of the use of resources between actual and planned
  % use of resources in Annex 1, especially related to person-months per work package.

All changes of use of resources were included in the two amendments previously cited and were
due to modifications in the personnel. Those adjustments were due to the change of positions
of some key \ODK participants and expected difficulties in hiring planned
staff. The work plan has been updated accordingly, with no foreseeable
impact on the achievement of tasks, deliverables, and milestones.

  \subsubsection{Unforeseen subcontracting (if applicable)}

Not applicable.

  \subsubsection{Unforeseen use of in kind contribution from third party against payment or
    free of charges (if applicable)}

 Not applicable.
