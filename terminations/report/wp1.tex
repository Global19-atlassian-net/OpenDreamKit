\subsubsection{Work Package 1: Project Management}

Like any other site in \ODK, Zurich devoted some of its PMs to project management (one, in fact). Because Zurich involved just one person, the task wasn't necessarily complicated or notable while the project was running. Nevertheless, the PI participated and assisted for a multitude of events and tasks, {e.g.}:
\begin{itemize}
\item preparation of the Consortium Agreement;
\item kickoff meeting and three progress meetings;
\item midterm review in M9, first reporting at M18;
\item setting up of the Advisory and Quality Review Boards;
\item internal activity reporting (timesheets)
\end{itemize}

Zurich being a node involved in just one Work Package, we never really carried much of the administrative work. 

The only noteworthy event here was that at M12 a change of employment status for Dehaye was required within the University of Zurich's procedures. Indeed, until then he had been employed by the University of Zurich on another contract (and working part-time on \ODK). At M12, a new contract was needed to employ him fully on \ODK. Effective collaboration with other partners in \ODK ensured a smooth transition, and that the scientific work was not impacted.
