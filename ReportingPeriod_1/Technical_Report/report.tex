\section{Explanation of the work carried out by the beneficiaries and Overview of the progress}

%•	Explain the work carried out during the reporting period in line with the Annex 1 to the Grant Agreement. 
%•	Include an overview of the project results towards the objective of the action in line with the structure of the Annex 1 to the Grant Agreement including summary of deliverables and milestones, and a summary of exploitable results and an explanation about how they can/will be exploited.
%(No page limit per workpackage but report shall be concise and readable. Any duplication should be avoided).

\subsection{Objectives}

%List the specific  objectives  for  the  project  as  described  in  section  1.1  of  Part B   and describe  the  work  carried  out  during  the  reporting  period  towards  the  achievement  of  each listed objective. Provide clear and measurable details.

\subsection{Explanation of the work carried per Work Package}
\subsubsection{WorkPackage 1}

%Explain, task per task, the work carried out in WP during the reporting period giving details of the work carried out by each beneficiary involved.

The general objectives of workpackage 1 are:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Meeting the objectives of the project within the agreed budget and timeframe and carrying out control of the milestones and deliverables}
\item{Ensure all the risks jeopardising the success of the projects are managed and that the final results are of good quality}
\item{Ensuring the innovation process within the project is fully aligned with the objectives set up in the Grant agreement}
\end{itemize}

\WPref{management} has been divided into 3 tasks. In the following, progress is reported with respect to these individual tasks.

Key results of WP1 are:

\begin{itemize}
\item{A Consortium Agreement was signed by all partners}
\item{1 kickoff meeting and 3 progress meetings were organised}
\item{\ODK passed the interim review at month 9 with the grade 3/4}
\item{All milestones have been reached and deliverables achieved within the 1st Reporting Period timeframe}
\item{Setting up of a new version of the \ODK website, with a more end-user friendly interface}
\item{Success in the recruitment of highly qualified staff}
\item{Several workshops open to different communities were organised and successful}
\item{An Advisory Board and Quality Review Board were set up to control the quality and the relevance of the sotware development relative to the end-user needs}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\longtaskref{management}{project-finance-management}}

A consortium agreement was signed
between partners, stating precise rules about topics such as:
responsibilities, governance, access to results and the background
included.  This consortium agreement respects the state of mind of the opensource software communities and does not plan to commercially exploit the Intellectual Property produced in the frame of \ODK.

During the 1st Reporting Period, a kick-off meeting was organised in Orsay, followed by
3 progress meetings at which partners presented status reports, and
the steering committee got together.  The first progress meeting was
organised in St Andrews (January 2016), the second one was located
in Bremen (June 2016), and the last one in Edinburgh (January 2017). The second meeting coincided with the interim project
review, planned at month 9, where deliverables due by then were
presented to the Project Officer and Reviewers. The \ODK\ project was
granted the grade 3 out of 4 for this interim review: ``Good progress
(the project has achieved most of its objectives and technical goals
for the period with relatively minor deviations)''.

As planned in WP1, \site{PS} has been coordinating \ODK.  The \site{PS} relevant administration body, the D.A.R.I. (Direction des Activités de Recherche et de l'Innovation) and its finance service took care of the budget repartition in November-December 2015. The D.A.R.I., with Florence Bougeret, is also leading the Financial Statement of this reporting period. Due to the length of the first reporting period (18 months), the \site{PS} administration had decided to organise an internal and interim
breakdown of costs at the middle of the Reporting Period. This exercise aimed at raising potential questions
from partners early on and to make sure partners do follow the EC
rules for the eligibility of costs. The coordinator is therefore confident that all partners will be able to declare their costs for this Reporting Period.

\site{PS} also lead the amendment number AMD-676541-5 which added to the consortium \site{UG}, and is currently leading the amendment number AMD-676541-13 for the addition of two new sites: Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg and the new laboratory European XFEL. The addition of these three new partners is due to the moving of key permanent and/or non-permanent researchers who are key personnel for the success of \ODK. A collateral effect is the termination of \site{SO}' participation to the consortium because no relevant staff for \ODK remained in this institution.
\site{UG} has recently agreed to sign this Consortium Agreement
without any modification to it.


Concerning the communication, intern communication tools are explicited in \longdelivref{management}{infrastructure}.
As for external communication the website for the project has been continuously
updated with new content, and virtually all work in progress is openly
accessible on the Internet to external experts and contributors (for
example through open source software on Github). A new version of the website was released on the 15/03/2017. Its end-user friendly interface and content makes it a tool turned towards dissemination rather than internal communication.

 
Furthermore \longdelivref{management}{data-plan1} gave a first version of the management of data produced \ODK. Propositions for the improvement of \delivref{management}{data-plan1}are made in Section 2 of this document. 


\paragraph{\longtaskref{management}{project-quality-management}}


TODO

The Quality Assurance Plan is described in detail in \longdelivref{management}{ipr}. We will describe the main points below.
\site{PS} launched a Quality Review Board which is chaired by Hans Fangohr. The four members of the board have a track record of caring about the quality in software for computational science. This board is responsible for ensuring key deliverables do reach their original goal and that best practice were in the writing process as well as in the innovation production process.
The board will meet after the end of eacha Reporting Period (RP), and before the Review following that RP.

The other tool enabling \ODK to ensure the quality of the infrastructure is the End-user group that is composed of some members of the Advisory Board (AB). It is composed of seven members:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Lorena Barba from the George Washington University}
\item{Jacques Carette from the McMaster University}
\item{Istvan Csabai from the Eötvös University Budapest}
\item{Françoise Genova from the Observatoire de Strasbourg}
\item{Konrad Hinsen from the Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire}
\item{William Stein, CEO of SageMath Inc.}
\item{Paul Zimmermann from the INRIA}
\end{itemize}

This AB being composed of Academics and/or software developers from different backgrounds, countries and communities, it will be a strong asset to understand the needs of a variety of end-user profiles. This Technical Report for the first Reporting Period will be the first occasion to ask for their feedback on the potential of the VRE and of our strategy to promote its use around the world.
According to the Consortium Agreement, all AB members have signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement with the consortium.

\site{PS} has also been managing risks. In \delivref{management}{ipr} all potential risks were assessed by the Coordinator. The risk concerning the recruitment of highly qualified staff has been globally well managed thanks to a flexible workplan enabling the delay of some tasks or deliverables, and thanks to legal actions taken by the Coordinator to allow key personnel permanent and non-permanent researchers to remain in the Consortium even though their positions changed. The addition of the three partners is representative of these actions.

%+ other risks!!! @Nicolas 

\paragraph{\longtaskref{management}{project-innovation-management}}

\longdelivref{management}{imp1} was produced at month 18 and is mainly focused on: 

\begin{itemize}
\item{The opensource aspect of the innovation produced within \ODK}
\item{The various implementation processes the project is dealing with}
\item{The strategy to match end-users needs with the promoted VRE}.
\end{itemize}

  The second version of the Innovation Management Plan will add content to explain all the
  innovations that the VRE is bringing to end-users. However the opensource approach and
  the "by users for users" development process will not change.  As it was stated above,
  one of the risks for \ODK is to have different groups not forming effective teams. Put
  in other words, having developers of the different pieces of software working solely for
  the benefit of the programme they were initially working on and for. This risk is
  tackled by the Coordinator in order to reach the final goals of the VRE which are the
  unification of opensource tools with overlapping functionality, the simplification of
  the tools for end-users without coding expertise, and the development of user-friendly
  interfaces. For this, the Scientific Coordinator is willfully pushing for joint
  workshops. Even if it takes time to bend old implementation processes and coding habits,
  more and actions are taken by \ODK participants from different communities to work
  together. More information on joint workshops can be found in the section below.


  \subsubsection{WorkPackage 2}
%Explain, task per task, the work carried out in WP during the reporting period giving details of the work carried out by each beneficiary involved.

  As planned in \longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination-communication} and
  \longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination}, 22 meetings, developer and training workshops have already
  been organized and co-organized by \ODK (including 14 have for year 1 described in \longdelivref{dissem}{workshops-1}) , and complemented by many
  presentations and activities in external events. This include the first Women in Sage workshop in Europe and the
  first major dissemination event of the project (Computational Mathematics with Jupyter in ICMS). This testifies
  of the vibrant activity and energy of the OpenDreamKit particpants.
  
  More specifically, we have targeted two specific communities:

\begin{compactitem}
\item The Mathematic community through specific Sage Days.
\item The micromagnetic community through specific workshops presenting
the \Jupyter and Python interface to the widely used OOMMF \longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-virtual-environment} (5 workshops so far).
\end{compactitem}  
  

  \ODK\ is also working on its visibility and communication strategy with an active website keeping track of all
  project activities including conferences, workshops, talks, blogposts, press releases, reports, etc.
  
\paragraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination-communication}}

The \longdelivref{dissem}{press-release-1} was delivered and a page for the \href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/blob/master/Communication/eInfra-Booklet/ODK.md}{E-infrastructure booklet} was written jointly by \ODK members. The website has been 
entirely rebuilt to better promote  and centralize project activities. At this date, 
we have 58 posts on our website which correspond to blogposts (14), conferences and workshops (11),
talks (14), and other project communication. The website also keeps track of press releases
and deliverable reports. We have recently added an open-source web analytics system (Piwik) 
to track some basic informations about our visitors.

\paragraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{training-portal}}

Training is a core and transversal aspect of our project. It is carried out 
through interventions and events as we discuss in \longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination} but also
by writing documentation, tutorials (\delivref{dissem}{short-course}), blogposts, etc. All
this communication is centralized on our website. We have created a specific 
page listing the different software which could eventually host training material. Furthermore,
each software has its own tag which links to all related project activities.

\paragraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{devel-workshops}}

Development workshops are a key aspect of OpenDreamKit development model. The aim of these workshops is to bring together developers from the different communities to design and implement some 
of the wanted features. As reported in \longdelivref{dissem}{workshops-1}, we have organized
or co-organized 5 of these workshops during year 1 of the project. Since then, 2 more have happened. The thematics varies
for each event: packaging and portability, Sage and Jupyter, Sage-Gap days, PARI/GP, knowledge representation, etc. To this,
we can add 4 project meetings which we always turn into an occasion for more coding sprints and development
discussions.

\paragraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{tech-review}}

This task has been started during our initial KickOff meeting where we organized a session of short
talk presenting many different technologies (Jupyter, SageMathCloud, Docker, Sphynx, Cython, Pythran, and
many more). Some of them were further developed into \delivref{dissem}{techno}. The goal is to
keep up to date with most recent breakthroughs related to our work in OpenDreamKit. When we felt
it was relevant, we turned part of the document into blogposts on our website gathered under a 
specific tag. At this date, we have published 4 articles and plan on publishing more throughout the
project.

\paragraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination}}

Dissemination is a key aspect of the success of OpenDreamKit. Indeed, our development is carried
out to help and support mathematical communities. One of goal is to bring
more users and more developers to the different project we are involved in. The events
that took place during Year 1 have been reported in \longdelivref{dissem}{workshops-1}, since then, still
more happened.

\begin{compactitem}
\item \textbf{Organization of Sage Days in established mathematical communities.} Sage Days have long been
part of the SageMath tradition. By organizing and supporting Sage Days, OpenDreamKit can stay close
the mathematical community, understand its needs, gather more users and developers, and improve
the over all quality of the software. We have been involved in 5 different such events since the beginning 
of the project.
\item \textbf{Training activities in developing countries.} OpenDreamKit has a long term plan of fostering
a SageMath community in the Mediterranean area where 3 different events where organized (Algeria, Lebanon, and Tunisia) 
and some more are planned in Morocco. We were also present at ECCO 2016 in Columbia and have been invited
to come back for the next conference in 2018. 
\item \textbf{Women in Sage.} OpenDreamKit is concerned with the gender gap in mathematic software development. 
We have organized the first Women in Sage conference in Europe, inviting 20 women to participate to a week of Sage development. We plan at least one other such event during the project.
\item \textbf{Computational Mathematics with Jupyter.} This was the first event of the 3 main dissemination conferences
planned throughout the project. It gathered a large mathematic community in ICMS, Edinburgh, in collaboration with the CoDiMa project.
\item \textbf{Jupyter Day in Orsay.} This one day training event in Orsay was fully booked shortly after it was announced, testifying of the growing interest of the community for the Jupyter project. It featured demos and talks from experts of the field as well as an afternoon of tutorials. 
\item \textbf{Other training and communication activities.} The participants of OpenDreamKit are very active
in spreading their knowledge and the project news to the different open source and mathematical communities they belong to. We count 11 talks on the website. We have been present to many major events: PyCon, EuroScyPy, CICM, CoDiMa school and more. 
\end{compactitem}

\paragraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{project-intro}}

At the occasion of the KickOff Meeting, Viviane Pons presented SageMathCloud: an online solution for collaborative
work on some OpenDreamKit software such as \Sage and \Jupyter. In particular, it offers a basic course management system that appeared to be a very good solution for some of the challenge described in this task. Following this talk, Michael Croucher implemented this solution for many courses at Sheffield university. This system is also used at Paris-Sud. As a result, the first goal of the task was achieved when we delivered \delivref{dissem}{short-course} on how to use SageMathCloud for teaching with OpenDreamKit technologies. 

We are also looking at nbgrader: at Southampton, the Jupyter Notebook and nbgrader were used to support teaching of large (~500 students) and more specialized engineering design teaching modules for students in the first year of their engineering degree programs.

\paragraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-virtual-environment}}

We created a GitHub organisation named JOOMMF, where the micromagnetic VRE code is publicly hosted (\href{https://github.com/joommf}{JOOMMF repo}). For each JOOMMF package we use \href{https://travis-ci.org/joommf/discretisedfield}{continuous integration on Travis CI} where we perform tests and monitor the test coverage, which we then make available on \href{https://codecov.io/}{Codecov}. Documentation for each package consists of APIs (automatically generated from the code) and different tutorials created in Jupyter notebooks. Both of them are tested on Travis CI. Documentation is build and made publicly available on \href{http://discretisedfield.readthedocs.io}{Read the Docs}. After every major milestone, we upload each package to the Python Package Index repository. We encourage the early use of our software and invite for feedback for which we provide several different communication channels: Google group (joommf-news), \href{https://gitter.im/joommf/}{Gitter channel}, \href{https://github.com/joommf/help}{GitHub help repository}, \href{https://twitter.com/joommf}{Twitter account}, and a \href{http://joommf.github.io/}{website}.

\paragraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-workshops}}

We had several workshops and tutorials so far where we demonstrated the use of our Micromagnetic VRE, received feedback and feature requests from the community:

\begin{compactitem}
\item two workshops at the 61st Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials in New Orleans,
    LA, USA (2nd and 3rd November 2016).
\item Tutorial at the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft Fruehjahrstagung (Spring Meeting) of the Condensed Matter Section in Dresden, Germany on 19th March 2017.
\item Workshop at the Institute of Physics Magnetism 2017 conference in York, UK on 5th April 2017.
\item Workshop at the IEEE International Magnetics Conference - Intermag 2017, Dublin, Ireland. 24th April 2017.
\end{compactitem}

\paragraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{ibook}}


The first book we committed to deliver is \emph{Linear Algebra (lectures for physicists)} \delivref{dissem}{ibook2}. It is under active development \href{https://github.com/Hadriamit/iODKbook2}{as you can see on its git repo}. Our main issue is now to complete the English version (it already exists in polish). We chose to use It Sphinx and the Sagecell plug-in. The remaining books are at earlier stage. They will include some ideas and teaching materials which are developed at the moment.

Moreover, at Southampton, we have started to create interactive notebooks that support teaching of mathematics and computing to engineers. In particular, we have studied the feasibility of converting existing teaching materials (in LaTeX) containing code snippets into interactive notebooks. This is work in progress. We worked together with the Simula team in directing the design of the (NBVAL) software developed in \taskref{UI}{notebook-verification} of the OpenDreamKit project (\delivref{UI}{adcomp}), which addresses one of the questions outlined in this task: How can we facilitate automatic testing of all code examples, plots, etc.

\TODO{}

  \subsubsection{WorkPackage 3}
%Explain, task per task, the work carried out in WP during the reporting period giving details of the work carried out by each beneficiary involved.
  The first task of this workpackage is to improve the portability of computational
  components \longtaskref{component-architecture}{portability}. A particular challenge is
  the portability of \Sage\ (and therefore all its dependencies) on Windows, which has
  remained elusive for a decade, despite many efforts of the community. We are happy to
  report that, in particular thanks to months of intensive and expert work by our recruit
  Erik Bray at \site{PS}, this challenge is about to be tackled, almost one year before
  the expected delivery time.

  Task \taskref{component-architecture}{interface-systems} on interfaces between
  mathematical systems is progressing as expected. Experimental work on a semantic
  interface between \GAP and \Sage
  (\delivref{component-architecture}{semantic-interface-sage-gap}, due on month 36) has
  started during the joint GAP-Sage days, and a working prototype is already
  available. The current prototype uses \emph{ad hoc} language mechanisms to transfer the
  semantics from one system to the other; these mechanisms will be replaced with a generic
  API (Application programming Interface) once the MitM (Math-in-the-Middle) approach
  developed in WP6 will be mature enough. Meanwhile, a purely technical piece of the
  puzzle has been already achieved as part of
  \delivref{component-architecture}{scscp-sage}, bringing support for the SCSCP
  protocol\footnote{SCSCP, the
    \href{http://www.symbolic-computing.org/science/index.php/SCSCP}{Symbolic Computation
      Software Composability Protocol} is a web protocol based on OpenMath enabling remote
    procedure calls across computer algebra systems} to the Python ecosystem, and thus to
  \Sage and its subsystems. This is instrumental for supporting the MitM approach.

  After \longdelivref{component-architecture}{virtual-machines} was delivered, a focused
  workshop in March (Sage Days 77) also triggered much work and progress on the packaging
  side (\taskref{component-architecture}{mod-packaging}), both by \ODK participants and
  the community. There is now good hope to have proper packages for \Sage (and its
  dependencies) on the Debian distribution in the coming months, a feature that has been
  desperately longed for for over a decade.  The workshop was also the occasion to clarify
  the modularization, packaging, and distribution needs and challenges. Internal notes on
  the progress made have been taken in the
  \href{https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77/packaging}{\Sage wiki}, and a
  \href{https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-packaging}{mailing list specifically
    dedicated to packaging \Sage} has been created.

  Task \longtaskref{component-architecture}{oommf-python-interface} has been completed and
  is available online on \href{https://github.com/joommf/oommfc}{github}, and through the
  Python packaging index.

  \subsubsection{WorkPackage 4}
%Explain, task per task, the work carried out in WP during the reporting period giving details of the work carried out by each beneficiary involved.
  The first task for this workpackage is to enable the use of Jupyter as uniform notebook
  interface for the relevant computational components \taskref{UI}{ipython-kernels}. This
  is well under way for most components. Progress was particularly fast for \Sage thanks
  to a very active involvement of the community; this will enable, in the coming months, a
  systematic transition from the legacy \Sage notebook system to \Jupyter; this is a
  particularly important achievement: beside all the benefits of a uniform and actively
  developed interface for the user, outsourcing the maintenance of the notebook interface
  will save the \Sage community much needed resources.

  A new \Jupyter package, nbdime, was created for \delivref{UI}{jupyter-collab} enabling
  easier collaboration on notebooks via version control systems such as git.  This project
  was presented at the major Scientific Python conferences SciPy US in July and EuroSciPy
  in August, and has been met with enthusiasm from the scientific Python community for its
  prospect of solving a longstanding difficulty in working with notebooks.  Work has begun
  on a new package, nbval, for \delivref{UI}{jupyter-test}, which will integrate the above
  nbdime package for delivering testable, reproducible notebooks via traditional software
  development testing practices.

  The JupyterHub package has received updates and further development, specifically a
  Services extension point, which enables shared workspaces for collaboration, a step on
  the path toward real-time collaboration for \delivref{UI}{jupyter-live-collab}.

  Active structured documents are a common need with many use cases, and as many potential
  solutions. Requirements and venues for collaborations were explored through discussions
  between participants, in particular at the occasion of
  \href{https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77/}{Sage Days 77} workshop (see the
  \href{https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77/live-structured-documents}{notes}), and June's
  ODK meeting in Bremen. The findings were reported in \delivref{UI}{adstex}. Sage Days 77
  was also the occasion to bootstrap the long term work of
  \href{https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77/documentation}{refactoring the Sage documentation
    build system} (\delivref{UI}{sage-sphinx}) in collaboration with a Sphinx developer.

  One deliverable, \delivref{UI}{pari-python-lib1}, was delayed by a couple months due to
  unforeseen technical difficulties, but with no impact on the rest of the project.


  \subsubsection{WorkPackage 5}
%Explain, task per task, the work carried out in WP during the reporting period giving details of the work carried out by each beneficiary involved.
  After \delivref{hpc}{sage-paral-tree} was delivered, \longtaskref{hpc}{pythran} is
  making good progress towards the development of Pythran and its interaction with~\Sage.
%
  More precisely, Pythran's typing system (\delivref{hpc}{pythran-typing}) has been
  improved in two ways: first, the compiler now more accurately tracks the identifier
  $\leftrightarrow$ value binding, which in turns makes it possible to generate strongly
  typed code for a wider class of Python kernels.  Second, an unsound type checker for
  Pythran has been developed. It provides human-readable error report when a type error is
  detected at compile time, when a cryptic internal error was previously reported. Both
  algorithms have been extensively detailed in separated blog posts and the resulting
  implementation is part of the official Pythran 0.8.0 release
  (\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/117}{details}).

  The start of Deliverable~\delivref{hpc}{pythran-sage} has been delayed from Month 12 to
  Month 18 due to the difficulty of hiring an engineer for the task.  It is now making
  good progress.

  Deliverable~\longdelivref{hpc}{MPIRsuperoptimiser} is making progress but has hit a
  major blocker: it requires to use a precise clock cycle counter, for which a kernel
  module has been proposed in this deliverable. However a bug in the Linux kernel seem to
  automatically disable these counters. It has been reported upstream but the long delay
  to have a patch incorporated into the kernel will impact the delivery of this
  deliverable. There is no dependency to this deliverable, and the problem is now well
  understood and its solution is underway
  (\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/118}{details}).

  As mentioned in the initial proposal, work on \taskref{hpc}{hpc-linbox} (LinBox) is just
  starting in September 2016 instead of December 2015, as the members of this group had
  already too many PM involved in other projects. However this will not not have any
  impact on the workplan as the PM will be doubled in the three first trimesters of year
  4.

  A first workshop on HPC will be organized in March 2017 in Grenoble, France. A smaller
  workshop may possibly be organized in December 2016, to gather participants involved in
  the development and Pythran.

  \subsubsection{WorkPackage 6}
%Explain, task per task, the work carried out in WP during the reporting period giving details of the work carried out by each beneficiary involved.
  In a series of workshops (September 2015 in Paris, January 2016 in St. Andrews, June
  2016 in Bremen, and July 2016 in Bia{\l}ystok) the participants working on
  \WPref{dksbases} met and discussed the topic of integrating the \pn systems into a
  mathematical VRE toolkit.  Key results were
  \begin{compactitem}[\bf R1.]
  \item the observation that \emph{knowledge-aware interoperability of software and
      database-systems is the most critical objective} for \WPref{dksbases} in the \pn
    project.
  \item the consensus that this can be achieved by \emph{aligning the mathematical
      knowledge underlying the various systems}.
  \end{compactitem}
  This requires explicitly representing the three aspects of math VREs -- Data (D),
  Knowledge (K), and Software (S) -- and basing computational services and inter-system
  communication on a joint \DKS-base. These results are engrained in the
  ``Math-in-the-Middle'' (MitM) paradigm~\cite{DehKohKon:iop16}, which gives a
  representational basis for specification-based interoperability of mathematical software
  systems -- so that they can be integrated in a VRE toolkit. In the MitM paradigm, the
  mathematical knowledge underlying the VREs (K) and the the interface of the for each
  system (S) are represented as modular theory graphs in the OMDoc/MMT format. For the
  data aspect (D) we have extended the concept of OMDoc/MMT theories to ``virtual
  theories'' that allow the practical management of possibly infinite theories,
  see~\cite{ODK-D6.2} for details.

  A side effect of the \textbf{R1.} is that the verification aspects anticipated in the
  proposal are non-critical to the \pn project. In particular the value of the exemplary
  verification of an LMFDB algorithm in \taskref{dksbases}{data-LMFDB} and
  deliverable~\delivref{dksbases}{lfmverif} seems highly questionable.

  Correspondingly we have refined the notion of ``triformal theories'' coined in the
  proposal into the concept of ``\DKS theory graphs'', which can be formalized and
  implemented without the extension of OMDoc/MMT for ``biformal theories'' anticipated in
  the proposal.

  Through the concerted effort of the WP6 participants, we have been able to implement
  this design into prototypical \DKS base patterned after the MitM paradigm with virtual
  theories, generating interface theory graphs for the \GAP and \Sage systems and
  integrating the \LMFDB system via the MitM codec architecture described
  in~\cite{ODK-D6.2}. Based on this, we were able to generically integrate \GAP, \Sage,
  and \LMFDB via the standardised SCSCP protocol~\cite{HorRoz:ossp09} -- essentially
  remote procedure calls with OpenMath Objects. This case study shows the feasibility of
  the initial design of \DKS-bases; further investigations and the integration of
  additional systems will determine the practicability.

  \subsubsection{WorkPackage 7}
%Explain, task per task, the work carried out in WP during the reporting period giving details of the work carried out by each beneficiary involved.
  Ursula Martin has stepped down in anticipation of her upcoming retirement, and Dmitrii
  Pasechnik has become the lead PI for this work package.  This somewhat slowed down the
  takeoff of this work package, but the important deliverables are well on track, if not
  ahead of schedule. Nevertheless, the consortium may need to request for a new amendment
  after the Review of the 1st Reporting Period to clarify the situation.

  As planned, the work was focused on bootstrapping
  \longtaskref{social-aspects}{social-input} and
  \longtaskref{social-aspects}{isocial-decisionmaking} whose early outcomes will nurture
  the design of \ODK's VREs in other work packages.

  For \taskref{social-aspects}{social-input},
  \longdelivref{social-aspects}{social-datareport} analysing in particular the state of
  affairs in our model system \Sage, is well on track to be delivered at Month 18, with
  Part I ready.

  For \longtaskref{social-aspects}{isocial-decisionmaking},
  \delivref{social-aspects}{social-tracaddon} is largely ready and is to be tested on the
  system \Sage; a paper \cite{Pavlou:2016:MCI:2936924.2936934} forming a part of
  \delivref{social-aspects}{social-gametheoretic} has been published.

  Finally, early work was done for \taskref{social-aspects}{social-output} on connections
  of reproducibility, crowdsourcing, and a VRE as a mean to test and control the former: a
  paper \cite{2016arXiv160100181C} analysing a concrete well-established area of
  combinatorics in this respect, and describing the implementation of the corresponding
  meta-database in \Sage system has been published.

  \subsection{Impact}
  % Include in this section whether the information on section 2.1 of the DoA (how your
  % project will contribute to the expected impacts) is still relevant or needs to be
  % updated. Include further details in the latter case

  All the information of section 2.1 of the DoA is still relevant. There is for now no
  change to bring to Key Performance Indicators. The evolution of the measures between
  Month 18 and Month 36 will allow the Coordinator to evaluate if the selected KPI are
  appropriate.

  There was no major deviation frol Annex 1. All deliverables due for M18 were delivered
  within the timeframe of the 1st Reporting Period, and all milestones in this period were
  reached.  Slight modifications were brought to \WPref{hpc} and \WPref{????} and were
  included in the AMD-676541-13.


  Some deliverables names in \WPref{hpc} were modified
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \delivref{hpc}{MPIRsuperoptimiser} from "Extend the existingassembly
    superoptimiser for AVX and upcoming Intel processor extensions for the MPIR library"
    to "Write an assembly superoptimiser supporting AVX and upcoming Intel processor
    extensions for the MPIR library and optimise MPIR for modern processors"
  \item \delivref{hpc}{QS-linalg} from"Parallelise the relation sieving component of the
    Quadratic Sieve and implement a parallel version of Block-Wiederman linear algebra
    over GF2 and the triple large prime variant" to "Parallelise the relation sieving
    component of the Quadratic Sieve and implement a parallel version of Block-Wiederman
    linear algebra over GF2 and implement large prime variants"
  \item \delivref{hpc}{FFT} from "Take advantage of multiple cores in the matrix Fourier
    Algorithm component of the FFT for integer and polynomial arithmetic,and include
    assembly primitives for SIMD processor instructions (AVX, Knight's Bridge, etc.),
    especially in the FFT butterflies" to "Take advantage of multiple cores in the matrix
    Fourier Algorithm component of the FFT for integer and polynomial arithmetic,and
    include assembly primitives for SIMD processor instructions (e.g. AVX, etc.),
    especially in the FFT butterflies"
  \end{enumerate}

  Some titles of the \WPref{dksbases} deliverables were modified to respect the change in
  priority on system interoperability and distributed computing in the
  ``Math-in-the-Middle'' Paradigm over algorithm verification:
  \longdelivref{dksbases}{psfoundation}, \longdelivref{dksbases}{pssem}, and
  \longdelivref{dksbases}{lfmverif}
