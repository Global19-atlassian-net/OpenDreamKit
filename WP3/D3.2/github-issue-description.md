Part of OpenDreamKit's mission is to work on component architecture and also user interfaces for better collaboration. In this regard, the open source on-line platform [SageMathCloud](http://cloud.sagemath.com/), even thought it is not directly developed by ODK, is among our primal interests. It has been described as an emergent technology in [D2.3](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/43) and it is used as a support for a teaching tutorial using OpenDreamKit technologies in [D2.4](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/44). 

Some of the most important technologies of OpenDreamKit, such as Jupyter and SageMath, are distributed on-line through the SageMathCloud platform. It makes it a good mean to distribute some of the newly developed ODK features, for example new Jupyter kernels. It is very probable that many users will benefit from some of the ODK new developments through SageMathCloud.  Besides, the inner technologies of SageMathCloud are of special interest to ODK developers: they show advanced uses of cutting-edge web technologies and explore new leads that could inspire the work we do in ODK.

For all these reasons, is has been the wish of OpenDreamKit to get involved into the development of the SageMathCloud platform. This deliverable marks the first step in this direction. We start exploring the main layers of SageMathCloud backend code and give a general overview of its functioning. The material we have produced can directly help the platform attract more developers. One of the expected follow-up is an easy install for a local version of SageMathCloud especially designed for development which could be part of up-coming [D3.5](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/63). The long term goal however is to understand the extent of a full install of a SageMathCloud instance on a server: how hard is it? How much does it cost to maintain? Is it a reasonable solution for an institution do so?
