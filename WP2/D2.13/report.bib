  abstract={The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

@article{Cortes2018,
abstract = {Understanding the role of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) for the formation of helimagnetic order, as well as the emergence of skyrmions in magnetic systems that lack inversion symmetry, has found increasing interest due to the significant potential for novel spin based technologies. Candidate materials to host skyrmions include those belonging to the B20 group such as FeGe, known for stabilising Bloch-like skyrmions, interfacial systems such as cobalt multilayers or Pd/Fe bilayers on top of Ir(111), known for stabilising N$\backslash$'eel-like skyrmions, and, recently, alloys with a crystallographic symmetry where anti-skyrmions are stabilised. Micromagnetic simulations have become a standard approach to aid the design and optimisation of spintronic and magnetic nanodevices and are also applied to the modelling of device applications which make use of skyrmions. Several public domain micromagnetic simulation packages such as OOMMF, MuMax3 and Fidimag already offer implementations of different DMI terms. It is therefore highly desirable to propose a so-called micromagnetic standard problem that would allow one to benchmark and test the different software packages in a similar way as is done for ferromagnetic materials without DMI. Here, we provide a sequence of well-defined and increasingly complex computational problems for magnetic materials with DMI. Our test problems include 1D, 2D and 3D domains, spin wave dynamics in the presence of DMI, and validation of the analytical and numerical solutions including uniform magnetisation, edge tilting, spin waves and skyrmion formation. This set of problems can be used by developers and users of new micromagnetic simulation codes for testing and validation and hence establishing scientific credibility.},

abstract = "We report on the effect of demagnetizing fields due to magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (NPs) on the efficiency of TiO2 based dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC). The addition of Fe3O4 NPs into the photoanode enhanced the power conversion efficiency of DSSC. This may be attributed to the magnetic field effect induced by the demagnetizing field produced by the magnetite NPs, which is evident from our micromagnetic simulation. Essentially, such a stray field would induce additional force on the electron motion and thereby enhancing the recombination time of these charge carriers. Enhancement in recombination time is directly evidenced by the increase in short circuit current density. In addition, we have carried out an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study to probe the mechanism of charge transport within the DSSC device. Quenching of intensity in phosphorescence data indeed infer a decrease in recombination rate. We calculated the value of demagnetization energy from NPs with micromagnetic simulations. Absorbed energy density of âsâ and âpâ polarized incident light estimated using transfer matrix model."
