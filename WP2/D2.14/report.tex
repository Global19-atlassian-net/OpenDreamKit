\subsection{Reducing barriers for learners using interactive textbooks}

The Jupyter notebook as a virtual research environment holds great
potential for the creation and use of interactive documents. In this
context, we investigate and prototype the use of such interactive
notebooks in the context of education at the university level.

There is a long history in academia to provide textbooks either as
the main point of reference for a given lecture course, or as an
additional "background reading" to provide more details which cannot
be covered by blackboard- or slide-centred lectures, typically due to
the lack of time available for that type of learning learning.

While providing potentially a wealth of information, such textbooks
are static, and require unusual skill to be exclusively learned
from. Instead, it is a common model to ask students to carry out
practical problem-solving exercises: this enforces engagement with the
material and supports deep learning of the subject.

For computatioal problems, there is often significant effort required
to set up an environment of software (such as Python with required
libraries) and then a problem environment that allows the study of the
topic under investigation. For example, to solve a differential
equation numerically, one the problem environment includes setting up
functions describing the ODE, boundary conditions, and a grid on which
the numerical solution should be obtained. Once this point is reached,
the student can start to explore - for example - the properties of a
numerical method being used to solve differential equations.

The interactive textbooks developed here allow to improve the
learning experience by significantly reducing this barrier: both the
software environment and setting up the problem environment are
reduced to open the interactive document in a browser, and navigating
to the point of interest in the text book.

\subsection{Computational Science and Engineering}

The application of mathematics in science and engineering is the topic
of the textbook "Introduction to Computational Science and
Engineering".

The work is based on a text book that was available as a PDF file (and
generated from a \LaTeX{} file). In this deliverable, we have reviewed
the textbook and updated it from Python 2 to Python 3, added various
sections and a chapter on Pandas, but most importantly translated the
LaTeX sources into Jupyter Notebooks. Furthermore, we demonstrate and
enhance tools such as the \texttt{bookbook} and \texttt{nbconvert}
package to enable the automatic translation of the Jupyter notebook
chapters into a single PDF or a set of HTML pages.

The PDF is created using LaTeX as an intermediate translation, and
then by compiling the LaTeX to create a high quality PDF file. A LaTeX
file with custom style settings can be given as a template to the
\texttt{bookbook} package. The different chapters (each being one notebook)
are merged automatically, and get a joint table of contents.

The set of HTML files is organised into one HTML file per chapter
(each being created from one notebook), and an additional index file
providing links to all chapters.

The translation of the Jupyter-notebook based textbook into PDF and
HTML files is important to provide (at least) the same level of
publication quality outputs that can be expected from the more
traditional LaTeX based manuscript.

The additional value comes from the the Jupyter Notebook based
nature of the chapters:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Students can download the notebooks, and inspect all
  computational steps that have created the results shown in the
  textbook; they can execute them on their own machine, modify,
  explore, understand, and extend the examples. As all computational
  steps are included in the notebooks, there is no guessing about
  assumptions, no code being executed before an example is introduced,
  or no reconstructions of sections labelled ``the required
  transformation of X is left as an exercise to the reader'' required:
  all steps are contained in the notebooks. This reduces the barrier
  towards learning. Nevertheless, to download and execute the
  notebooks on their own machines, students still need to install the
  required software enivronment: in this case a standard Anaconda
  Python distribution is sufficient as only the standard scientific
  Python stack are required dependencies (such as numpy, scipy,
  matplotlib, pandas, and the notebook itself).

\item This required installation of the software environment can be
  avoided using the Binder project (XXX (which Task/Deliv? XXX
  Marijan: probaby D1.5 but Min has to confirm). As the
  \texttt{MyBinder.org} instance can create a cloud-based Jupyter
  Notebook with a software specification (for example through a python
  \texttt{requirements.txt} file) on demand, every student can start
  their own notebook server on MyBinder, browse chapters, and execute
  chapter notebooks as they like to achieve better understanding. As
  all of this happens in the browser, there is no software
  installation required.
