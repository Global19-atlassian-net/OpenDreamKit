This deliverable reviews emerging technologies that did not exist, or were not sufficiently visible at the time the OpenDreamKit proposal was written. Its goal is to inform other Work Packages on technologies that have a potential impact on the achievement of their tasks, and to suggest corrective actions to be undertaken when needed. A secondary goal for this review is to inform the general public about technologies related to OpenDreamKit.

Parts of this deliverable appeared, or will appear, on [OpenDreamKit's weblog](http://opendreamkit.org), and we will keep posting reviews there as new technologies emerge.
