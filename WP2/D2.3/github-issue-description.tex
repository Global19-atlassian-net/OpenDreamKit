This deliverable reviews emerging technologies that did not exist, or
were not sufficiently visible at the time the OpenDreamKit proposal was
written. Its goal is to inform Work Packages on technologies that have a
potential impact on the achievement of their tasks, and to suggest
corrective actions to be undertaken when needed. A secondary goal for
this review is to inform the general public about technologies related
to OpenDreamKit.

Parts of this deliverable appeared, or will appear, on
\href{http://opendreamkit.org}{OpenDreamKit's weblog}, and we will keep
posting reviews there as new technologies emerge.
