\begin{event}{Netmath presentation}{netmath}{Kaiserslautern, Oct. 20, 2017}{PS}{5}{1}{https://www.netmath.de/}

\textbf{Main goals.} Presentation of \Sage, Jupyter and OpenDreamKit to the Netmath community.

\textbf{\ODK implication.} Viviane from \ODK did the presentation and the travel cost was covered by \ODK.

\textbf{Event summary.} The Netmath community is an online network for university mathematic teaching, especially interested in sharing innovative methods and advice. This was their annual gathering and they invited us to present the project and how it can be used for teaching.

\textbf{Results and impact.} Some \ODK tools such as \Sage and Jupyter can be very useful for teaching. Many \ODK partners have worked into this direction and directly used some features developed by \ODK and others for their teaching. This was an occasion to share our knowledge and expertise with another community. We received very good feedback from the Netmath organizers.
