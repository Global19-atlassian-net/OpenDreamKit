The 8th Atelier PARI/GP took place in Clermont-Ferrand (France) from june
19th to 23rd with a special focus on Elliptic curves, Modular Forms and
$L$-Functions.

There were 36 registered participants from 16 different institutions
(no registration fees).

A typical day of the workshop had introductory talks and tutorials
in the morning; afternoons allowed ample time for hacking sessions,
discussions and training.

The Atelier featured 13 morning talks.

\textbf{Results and impact.} 
% What did you achieve with this event? (If ever it impacted 
% other ODK tasks and deliverables, mention it here)
This was a dissemination event with a special focus on recently developped
packages (Elliptic curves over number fields, Modular forms), before they were
merged into a formal release. We got lots of feedback on the interface and
documentation and a number of bugs and glitches were fixed as a result.
