\textbf{Main goals} Teach Social Scientists how to use Python and Jupyter notebooks to interact with online data sets.

\textbf{ODK implication.} ODK was involved in this work via ODK-funded team member Tania Allard.

\textbf{Event summary.}

Web data in Python for non computer scientists is a set of Jupyter notebooks and materials on how to use Python to collect, clean and analyse web data.

 It was developed in conjunction with Sheffield Research Methods Institute (An organisation created to promote innovation in research methods that can be applied to the social sciences to ultimately help solve the big challenges facing todayâ€™s society.)

In addition to developing and open sourcing the materials a workshop on the topic and using the materials was taught on May 18th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd along with other Software Carpentry workshops.

\textbf{Results and impact.} Materials are available online at \url{https://github.com/trallard/WebData_Python}
