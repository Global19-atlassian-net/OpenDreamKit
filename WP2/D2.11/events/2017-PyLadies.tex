\textbf{Main goals.} The PyLadies organization is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. PyLadies Paris is the local Paris chapter.

\textbf{\ODK implication.} Viviane Pons from \ODK has been the co-organizer of the PyLadies Paris events for the last two years. The Meetup group has 494 members and has had 57 events.

\textbf{Event summary.} Meetup include networking events for women coders such as ``Talking Bar'' and ``Coding Caf√©''. They usually gather between 3 and 10 participants. Some events include presentations and / or tutorials on some specific subjects.

\textbf{Demographic.} These events are open to women who are interested in python. This include professional python developers, academics, scientist, students, and enthusiast learners.

\textbf{Results and impact.} We believe such events are very important to support women coders. They allow to build a strong professional network. It is also an occasion to discuss python practices and, in particlar, \ODK developments in an informal and relaxed atmosphere.
