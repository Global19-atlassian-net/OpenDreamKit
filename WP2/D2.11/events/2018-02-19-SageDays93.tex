\textbf{Main goals.}
The main goal of the Sage Days 93 were to
gather researcher specialists in Lie groups and advanced
SageMath and PARI/GP developers. The two goals were to implement
more Lie group theory in the softwares and conversely produce
experimental results for researchers.


\textbf{ODK implication.}

\ODK organizer: V. Delecroix.

\ODK provided the funding source for the workshop (accommodation,
subsistence and travel expenses) for about 20k\euro.

\textbf{Event summary.}

subgroups.

There were 11 registered participants. A typical day of the workshop
consisted in talks and hacking session.

\textbf{Results and impact.} 
% What did you achieve with this event? (If ever it impacted 
% other ODK tasks and deliverables, mention it here)
This was a development workshop dedicated to researcher in Lie groups
and their lattices. We obtain interesting feedback and developed
a lot of features related to Lie groups in SageMath and PARI/GP.
