\begin{event}{Advances in Magnetism 2018 - Computational micromagnetics with JOOMMF tutorial}{AIM2018}{La Thuile, Italy, 04-07 Fabruary 2018}{XFEL}{100}{1}{No url.}

\textbf{Main goals.} We gave a tutorial about computational micromagnetics and JOOMMF to all conference participants.

\textbf{ODK implication.} JOOMMF was developed as a part of the ODK project and one participant from the ODK was present to deliver the tutorial (Marijan Beg). The tutorial was fully funded from the ODK funds and the total costs were 1207.73 euros.

\textbf{Event summary.} This tutorial was in the official part of the conference programme available to all atendees. We had about 100 participants and we introduced to them the basics of computational micromagnetics as well as gave them an introduction to JOOMMF. At the end, we answered any specific question attendees had.

\textbf{Demographic.} We had around 100 participants, but the organisers did not allow us to have their personal details due to the data protection.

\textbf{Results and impact.} We informed the community of potential users about the benefits of JOOMMF and provided to them enough information if they want to start using it.
