\textbf{Main goals.}

The LinBox developper meeting are meant to gather developper and users of the
LinBox ecosystem (composed of \texttt{givaro}, \texttt{fflas-ffpack} and
\texttt{LinBox}).

The main goals are to enable interraction between the several groups of
developpers and users in order to share experiences, take collegial design
decision and practice collaborative code writing.

The Grignan LinBox developper meeting took place in Grignan (France), from June
20th to 22nd.

There were 9 participants from 3 different institutions (UGA, Universit√©
Montpellier 2, US Naval Academy).
No registration fees were applied.

After a round table branstorming on developpment projects for the meeting,
developpers gathered in groups each adressing a given project.
The main achievements of the meeting include
\begin{itemize}
\item Progress on the distributed parallel ration solver (\delivref{hpc}{LinBox-distributed});
\item Design and refactorization of the code for randomized algorithms in LinBox;
\item Completion of the rewrite of the prime fields in Givaro;
\item Improvement of code robstness and release preparation (\delivref{hpc}{LinBox-algo}).
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Results and impact.} 
% What did you achieve with this event? (If ever it impacted
