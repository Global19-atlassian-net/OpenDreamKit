\textbf{Main goals.}
The main goal of the Sage Days 84 were to
gather researcher specialists in polyhedral computations and advanced
SageMath developers.

\textbf{\ODK implication.}

%Give a summary of your event

The Sage Days 84 took place in Olot (Spain) from february 2nd to
march 10th. It was focused on polyhedral computations.

There were 12 registered participants. A typical day of the workshop
consisted in talks and hacking session.

\textbf{Results and impact.}
% What did you achieve with this event? (If ever it impacted
% other \ODK tasks and deliverables, mention it here)
This was a development workshop dedicated to researcher polyhedral
computations. We obtain interesting feedback especialy from
the polymake developers Julian Pfeifle and Andreas Paffenholz. One
of the achievement was the integration in SageMath of an interface
to polymake
(see \url{https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22452}).
