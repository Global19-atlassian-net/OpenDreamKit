An important key to the success of the ODK project is linked to its
ability to \textbf{foster a community} in the spirit of the open source
projects it is built on. Part of this relies on the organization and
participation to scientific and development events of many different
scales and objectives. Following up on D2.12
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/42}{\#42})
for year 1, we report here on more than fifty events we have been part
of during year 2 and 3 of the project. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  (co)organization of development workshops;
\item
  (co)organization of dissemination workshops;
\item
  training actions at external events;
\item
  communication and participation to external events;
\item
  actions taken to foster a community in developing countries.
\end{itemize}

We describe each event with its specific goals and explain the exact
implication of ODK in the organization and realization of the event. We
give a general overview of the impact of single events, thus drawing a
picture of ODK impact as a whole, and describe future directions for the
year to come.
