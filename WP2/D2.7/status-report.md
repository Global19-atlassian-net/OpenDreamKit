# Introduction

The objective of task [T2.10](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/33) is to deliver an open-source
community-curated indexing tool for resources in computational
mathematics. The goal is to collect examples, tutorials, lessons,
and exercises related to a system or a field, under a unique hub, while
maintaining the quality of the content through community curation.

Such a need has been felt in all communities involved in OpenDreamKit,
and each has come up with its own solutions.  The joint development
efforts under OpenDreamKit, and in particular the unifying force of
the common Jupyter notebook infrastructure, have given a unique
occasion to produce a unified solution applicable to all systems.
This report introduces *planetaryum*[^1], a web toolkit for building
curated Jupyter notebook collections.

Following the OpenDreamKit philosophy, *planetaryum* is not a single
piece of software, but rather a toolkit, meant to power many different
flavors of curated collections. While it may not cover all possible
use cases, it is versatile enough to adapt to many needs of the
community.

# History

The need for maintaining various types of community curated help
resources has long been felt in any community involved in
OpenDreamKit.  Some interesting examples are:

- Most computer algebra systems maintain a section of their
  website[^2][^3] containing links to high quality resources on the
  web.

- Some systems also have a wiki, e.g. <http://wiki.sagemath.org/>.

- The French SageMath community also used to host a well curated wiki
  with pointers to many didactic resources. The wiki was taken down
  due to maintenance difficulties.

- SageMath maintains its own Q&A website at
  <https://ask.sagemath.org>, whereas most other systems rely on
  existing generic solutions such as StackOverflow[^4].

- For a long time, SageMath had been hosting a public instance of a
  SageMath server at <http://sagenb.org/>, where anyone could publish
  SageMath notebooks (old format incompatible with Jupyter) for
  everyone to view. The server had to be taken down among maintenance
  and security issues.

- The Jupyter project has a wiki page with a list of hand-selected
  notebooks[^11].

More recently, the Jupyter community has provided the NBViewer
service[^5].  It is a static notebook previewer service that takes as
input a URL pointing to a `.ipynb` file, and renders a static version
of it. The Binder service[^10] further lets the user edit and run
a copy of the notebook.
Importantly, those services do not host notebooks; they only
render them (possibly temporarily caching the rendered result).

Following the success of the Jupyter format, major code hosting
services like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket
have started rendering static versions
of Jupyter notebooks without relying on NBViewer.

The availability of these services has spurred a proliferation of
collections of notebooks hosted on them,
presented to the public through either NBViewer or the
service-builtin preview functionality.  However, this practice
has the major inconvenience of making it hard to search, classify,
and rank the notebooks.

When we sat down to plan for this deliverable, we wanted to provide a
solution to host, search, and rank public resources, produced and
curated by the community itself.

We started by evaluating available solutions. The first that we
studied was GÃ©ant OER[^6], a metadata aggregator for multimedia
content. It quickly became apparent that its focus on metadata and
multimedia did not suit our needs.

We also evaluated the *nbgallery*[^7] software, a solution for
hosting, indexing, searching, and ranking Jupyter notebooks. Despite its
potential, the application is rather unstable, and support is limited
given that it is essentially an internal project maintained by one
person. Indeed, we didn't manage to install a fully working
instance. Plus, although its advanced features are quite impressive,
it does not cover all the use cases we were interested in.

Only two months ago, *QuantEcon Notes*[^13] a curated collection of
Jupyer notebooks for economic modelling, was put online by the
QuantEcon project[^12]. We reached the QuantEcon coordinators to ask
about the software powering their platform, and learned that they plan
to open source it under the name "Bookshelf". The Bookshelf project
has an important overlap with the *planetaryum* project presented
here; however, having learned so late about it, we were not able to
benefit from it. We plan to look for synergies in the future, as we
learn more on the scope and the features of the Bookshelf project.

Finally, we experimented with a custom developed application[^8],
whose development had already started in 2015 at a SageMath
meeting. The application is capable of indexing, mirroring, searching
and ranking all types of resources found on the web, with dedicated
treatment for the most relevant formats, such as PDF, Jupyter,
SageMath, HTML, etc. Unfortunately, when an alpha version of the service
was deployed, it soon became apparent that it was not
being adopted by the community at large. This was partially
due to the service not being sufficiently easy to discover and use.
But in the end, it simply looked like the community did not feel the
need for such a generic tool, that was essentially trying (poorly)
to replicate the job of a web search engine.

# Planetaryum

After our first failed attempts, planetaryum arose as a new take on the
problem.  We realized that it was essential to recenter our efforts on
a well-defined type of document, rather than dispersing our users in a
format agnostic aggregator such as the sageindex experiment[^8].
The generalization of the Jupyter notebook as a common document format
for all OpenDreamKit systems presented a unique occasion to host
instructional resources in a unified way.

Planetaryum also came with the realization that not a single
application can fill all the user needs. We wanted to cover the
teacher hosting a gallery of a dozen notebooks on their course web page,
as well as the software community hub hosting thousands of
user-contributed notebooks.

## Use cases

Planetaryum is a modular Python library that can be used to build many
different applications with a few lines of code. Some of the most
requested applications are already bundled in the library and shipped
as a command-line executable.

Here we present a few possible use cases for Planetaryum.

1. **Static collection.** A (small) collection of notebooks can be
   used to generate a static website, based exclusively on HTML and
   JavaScript, and thus requiring very few resources for hosting. The
   appearance of the collection is customizable.

   Generating a gallery is as simple as running one command:

	   planetaryum static -i notebook_dir -o output_dir

   The website is generated in `output_dir`, and can be transferred to
   the hosting server by the usual means (e.g., FTP, ssh, etc.).

   This application is similar to a statically generated website, such
   as one may produce using popular tools like Sphinx[^14] or
   Jekyll[^15], and indeed several examples of such deployments exist.
   However, having a dedicated tool adds specific features for
   Jupyter notebooks, such as keyword search, tailored layouts, etc.
   Another advantage is that it is easy to scale up to more complex
   applications as described below.

2. **Medium sized collection, contributions via pull requests.** This
   model is suited for small to medium collections of notebooks where
   it is expected that the submission flow will be low and reserved to
   power users. It has the same advantages as the static collection,
   but at the same time it allows contributions, and can optionally be
   paired with a full-text search engine for better exploration.

   The website generation can be automatized through continuous
   integration tools, as documented in the planetaryum
   sources[^16][^9]: from a Binder-ready GitHub repository containing
   notebooks it is possible to automatically generate and host on
   GitHub Pages a static view of the repository, any time its contents
   change, thanks to Travis CI.

   We have set up a demonstration of this workflow at
   <https://opendreamkit.org/planetaryum-example-static/>.

3. **Large collection, user uploads.** This is a full-fledged
   application, backed by a database and a full-text search engine. It
   features filtering, user voting, and potentially other advanced
   features such as recommendation. All the build and deploy steps are
   controlled from the planetaryum executable. It is very similar in
   spirit to *nbgallery*[^7] or QuantEcon Notes[^13], but it is built
   with the same components as the other applications.


## Design

Planetaryum has a modular design, leading to many different types of
applications. Its main components are:

- **Readers** are responsible for reading a collection of notebooks
  from a medium (e.g., folder, git repository, ...),

- **Extractors** are responsible for parsing and transforming the
  output of a reader to a data stream.

- **Builders** take a data stream and produce an output (e.g., they
  populate a database or write files to disk); they can be chained to
  produce many effects at once (e.g., in a full stack application they
  both populate the database and write the front end files).

- **Front ends** are client side (HTML, JavaScript) applications that
  take the outputs of a builder and produce a user interface. The
  library contains a few very basic default front ends, but they are
  really intended to be developed as separate applications, with their
  own build chain, invoked by a dedicated builder at build time.

- **Apps** take all the above elements and link them together in a
  unique app with a well-defined scope. Planetaryum provides a few
  default apps, but the user is free to write their own.

- The **CLI** is a simple command-line interface that permits invoking
  the apps and passing parameters to them (through the command line,
  or through a configuration file).

## Limitations

Despite its flexibility, Planetaryum has the obvious limitation of
only supporting Jupyter notebooks. Although this reduces its scope, we
believe the choice was necessary to make a product that the user would
find easy to understand and attractive.

Other limitations, such as not supporting JavaScript-less browsers,
are purely technical and could be lifted pending enough demand.

## Deployments

For the time being, we have only made test deployments of planetaryum.
We now plan to use it for the thematic notebook collections published
by OpenDreamKit. In the near future, as the code base consolidates
and more use cases emerge, we expect planetaryum to become a tool of
choice for larger collections.

# Conclusion

Planetaryum fulfills and surpasses the original goal of having a tool
for maintaining community-curated collections of resources on
mathematical software.

We have come to it through a long process of trial and error that has
considerably delayed the deliverable. Ultimately, given the multitude
of tools trying to achieve similar goals, we felt that it would be a
waste of resources to try to build a rich application such as
originally planned, with the risk of not seeing it adopted.

Instead we focused on building a modular framework that could be used
right away for the simpler needs, such as producing personal or
project-related galleries of notebooks, and that could serve as a
building block for more complex applications. Towards this end, our
next step will be to look for synergies with similar projects, in
particular QuantEcon Notes.

Because of this it is hard, for the moment, to measure the impact of
planetaryum, but we are optimistic on its future adoption. We plan to
advertise it through our usual channels, and we will use
OpenDreamKit's notebook production itself as a vitrine for the tool.
