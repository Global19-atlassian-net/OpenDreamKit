We have announced the start of this project through diverse media linked
to the institutions and thematic of the different partners. A regularly
updated list is available from our web page:
\url{http://opendreamkit.org/follow/\#press-releases}

We intend to keep releasing relevant information to these media
throughout the project. In particular, we are in contact with the
\href{http://smf.emath.fr/}{Gazette de la SMF} for a one/two page letter
targeting the French Math community.
