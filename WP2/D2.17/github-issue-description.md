Notebooks -- interactive documents mixing prose, code, outputs, and visualization -- have existed for decades; we may cite the Maple, Mathematica, or SageMath notebook. There is a long time experience in the community of using such notebooks for a variety of purposes in teaching and research, ranging from scratchpad for interactive computation to narratives such as interactive teaching documents or logbooks of computational research.

At the time of writing the OpenDreamKit Proposal in 2014, the Jupyter notebook was a an emerging technology which had recently evolved from a generalization of IPython notebook that supported a variety of programming languages or interactive systems. Based on modern web technologies, with a modular design informed by many former implementations, and a growing ecosystem of related tools, it showed strong potential as core user interface component for building Virtual Research Environments. Of particular interest are the Jupyter widgets that bridge the gap between interactive computation and interactive visualization and applications, in effect making for a smooth continuous learning curve from user to power user to developer, and enlarging the range of use-cases.

In Task 2.6 (#29), we have disseminated Jupyter based Virtual Research Environment to students, researchers, and teachers to act as multipliers of knowledge and dissemination. This covered the technology but also best practices. The notebook, despite all its benefits, also has pitfals, with which the participants have extensive experience.

As reported on in our periodic deliverables on Community building: Impact of development workshops, dissemination and training activities D2.6 (#46) , D2.11 (#36) , D2.15 (#40), OpenDreamKit participants actively organized or participated in dozens of events where they advertised and delivered training on OpenDreamKit technology. In this report we start by reviewing other evaluation and dissemination activities that were carried out during the project. In a second section, we briefly reflect on the lessons learned. Indeed, these activities were also first and foremost the occasion to gather first hand testimony of the technology on the battle field, this to continuously inform and motivate the project.
