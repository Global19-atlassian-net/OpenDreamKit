An important key to the success of the ODK project is linked to its
ability to \textbf{foster a community} in the spirit of the open source
projects it is built on. Part of this relies on the organization and
participation to scientific and development events of many different
scales and objectives. Following up on D2.2
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/42}{\#42})
for year 1, and D2.11
\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/36}{\#36} for
year 2 and 3, we report here on more than 29 events we have been part of
during year 4. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the (co)organization of seven development workshops;
\item
  the (co)organization of ten training and community building workshops
  -\/- including one in a developing country and one targeted at women;
\item
  the organization of one research conference;
\item
  communications at and participation to eleven external events.
\end{itemize}

We describe each event with its specific goals and explain the exact
implication of ODK in the organization and realization of the event. We
give a general overview of the impact of single events, thus drawing a
picture of ODK impact as a whole.
