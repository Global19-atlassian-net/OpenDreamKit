An important key to the success of the ODK project is linked to its ability to **foster a community** in the spirit of the open source projects it is built on. Part of this relies on the organization and participation to scientific and development events of many different scales and objectives. Following up on D2.2 (#42) for year 1, and D2.11 #36 for year 2 and 3, we report here on more than 29 events we have been part of  during year 4. This includes:
- the (co)organization of seven development workshops;
- the (co)organization of ten training and community building workshops -- including one in a developing country and one targeted at women;
- the organization of one research conference;
- communications at and participation to eleven external events.

We describe each event with its specific goals and explain the exact implication of ODK in the organization and realization of the event. We give a general overview of the impact of single events, thus drawing a picture of ODK impact as a whole.
