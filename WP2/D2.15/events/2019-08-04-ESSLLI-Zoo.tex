\textbf{Main goals.}
In this course, we disseminated methods and solutions developed during \ODK to young researchers.
In particular, this involved the systematic modular formalization of formal languages in which mathematical knowledge is expressed.

\textbf{\ODK implication.}
The course was organised by Michael Kohlhase (FAU) and Florian Rabe (FAU).

\textbf{Event summary.}
The course consisted of 5 sessions of 90 minutes each, one each from Monday to Friday.
It was attended by undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students from mathematics, philosophy, and computer science.
Attendance was very big with 43 participants in the first sessions and 25 in the last.

\textbf{Results and impact.}
The main result of the workshop was the dissemination of key \ODK ideas and methods.
