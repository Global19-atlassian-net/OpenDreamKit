\begin{event}{SageMath classes in Crete}{crete}{Heraklion, March. 4-6, 2019}{PS}{10}{1}{}

\textbf{Main goals.} We organized a series of SageMath classes in the mathematical department of the Univeristy of Crete.

\textbf{ODK implication.} OpenDreamKit funded the trip of Viviane Pons to give the classes.

\textbf{Event summary.} A series of three classes was organized throughout the week. This was open both to students (from undergrad to PhD) and researchers of the math department of the Univeristy of Crete. The classes consisted of SageMath tutorials to allow the attendees to discover the software at their own pace. We used Jupyter notebooks with a focus on math related problems.

\textbf{Results and impact.} The students enjoyed the tutorials a lot. It was actually used as a starting point for more regular sessions tutored by their local teacher Eleni Tzanaki. We are now confident that SageMath will be taught at Univeristy of Crete as part of the math program.  The meeting was also an occasion to prepare the up-coming Women in Sage event also organized in Crete.
