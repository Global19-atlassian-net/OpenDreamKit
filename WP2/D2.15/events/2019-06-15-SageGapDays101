2019-06-17 to 2019-06-21}{PS}{20}{8}{https://wiki.sagemath.org/days101#Participants}

\textbf{\ODK implication.} \ODK participants: N. Thiéry, V. Delecroix, F.
Rabe, V. Klein, S. Lelièvre, L. de Feo, O. Benassy, E.M. Bray.

\textbf{Event summary.}In 2016, 2017 and 2018, PS ran week long developers days in a cosy
guest house in Cernay, just short of an hour from Paris by public transport, on *packaging,
portability, interfaces, and documentation tools for Sage and GAP*. We organized a follow up
on June of this year: same location, same themes.

\textbf{\ODK implication.}
The workshop was funded by OpenDreamKit, with material help from the Laboratoire de
Recherche en Informatique, the Mathematics and the Computer Science Departments at
Université Paris-Sud, Orsay. Accommodation and meals for all participants were covered
by ODK funding sources. OpenDreamKit participants covered their own travel expenses.


\textbf{Results and impact.}

There were 20 registered participants from 13 different institutions
(no registration fees).
A typical day of the workshop had coding sprints with regular project planning
in the morning; afternoons were devoted to brainstorms, tutorials, and
debriefing sessions. 
The Workshop also featured 5 demos on computer science in advanced mathematics topics.
