\textbf{Main goals.}

This is the yearly meeting of the French community in Computer
Algebra, open to an international audience, with lectures and
contributed talks given mostly in English.

\textbf{\ODK implication.}

Luca De Feo co-organized the JNCF 2019. The organization of the
workshop was coordinated with the organization of the ``Free
Computational Mathematics'' conference, taking place the following
week in the same venue, to encourage cross-participation.

Luca De Feo and Clément Pernet gave presentations on Monday on the
achievements of \ODK relevant to the Computer Algebra
community.

\ODK participants: Luca De Feo from University of Versailles,
Jean-Guillaume Dumas and Clément Pernet from University Grenobles
Alpes.

\ODK sponsored the event (3000\euro \TODO{Double-check the figure}).

\textbf{Event summary.}
%Give a summary of your event

This conference took place in Luminy (France) from February 4th to
8th. About 58 mathematicians and computer scientists participated to
the event. Three of the participants also participated to the ``Free
Computational Mathematics'' conference the following week, while four
other noted members of the French community in Computer Algebra, Joris
van der Hoeven, Marie Françoise Roy, Fredrik Johansson and Bill
Allombert, elected to only participate to the latter due to time
constraints.

Slides for Luca De Feo and Clément Pernet's presentations are
available online from the conference web page:

\textbf{Results and impact.}
% What did you achieve with this event? (If ever it impacted
% other \ODK tasks and deliverables, mention it here)

Computer Algebra is the birth place of computer-aided Mathematics, and
all of \ODK software owe something to the field. Over the years, \ODK
has constantly used the JNCF as an occasion to disseminate its
achievements relevant to the community, through contributed talks.

The last edition of JNCF to happen concomitantly with the project was
the occasion to double the dissemination efforts, and organize the
JNCF in tandem with the main \ODK conference ``Free Computational
Mathematics'': two invited talks at the ``Free Computational
Mathematics'' were delivered by noted members of the French Computer
Algebra community, while one of the invited lectures at JNCF was
delivered by Mohamed Barakat, a GAP developer and founder of the OSCAR
consortium, close to the \ODK community. A full session was devoted to
mathematical software on Monday afternoon, with two presentations
given by \ODK members, and one by a MapleSoft executive, which
triggered visible interest in the audience.

This was a successful workshop, and a great occasion to deliver 
successful developments of \ODK to its user base.
