\textbf{Main goals.} The goal of the event was for mathematicians
to improve their coding skills and knowledge of mathematical software.

\textbf{ODK implication.} Samuel Lelièvre (\ODK member from UPSud) was one of
the organisers. The OpenDreamKit funds at Paris-Sud were used to fund travel
and stays of speakers, \textbf{!!TODO!!}.

\textbf{!!TODO!! FAMNIT, SDAMS, ...}

\textbf{Event summary.} 
%The event consisted in a two-day Software Carpentry
%workshop (teaching participants the Unix shell, version control with Git,
%and programming with Python) followed by three days on mathematical software
%with mini-courses on CoCalc, GAP, Jupyter, PARI/GP, SageMath, YAGS, as well
%as talks on other mathematical software and databases, and on mathematical
%research using software. A problem session allowed participants to submit
%mathematical problems they cared about and thought software might help with,
%several of which were solved in the following days by other participants.

\textbf{Demographic.} 
%Over 140 people registered: 36\%\ bachelor students,
%10\%\ master students, 14\%\ PhD students, 6\%\ postdocs, 20\%\ professors
%and researchers, 10\%\ other. Since we could only welcome on the order of
%50 participants, we focused on PhD students, postdocs, professors and
%researchers.

\textbf{Results and impact.}
%What did you achieve with this event? (If ever it impacted 
%other ODK tasks and deliv, mention it here)
%
%During the Software Carpentry workshop, Tania Hernandez taught the Unix shell,
%Nelly Selem taught version control with Git, Leticia Vega taught programming
%with Python. These courses were taught in Spanish, although using supporting
%materials in English. This may have been the first time a Software Carpentry
%workshop was taught entirely in Spanish. An effort is underway to translate
%the Software Caprentry and Data Carpentry lesson plans to Spanish.
%
%During the mathematical software part, Alexander Hulpke taught GAP, Samuel
%Lelièvre taught CoCalc, Jupyter and SageMath, Miguel Pizaña taught YAGS
%(a GAP package for working with graphs), Miguel Raggi presented Discreture
%(a library for enumerating combinatorial objects), Emmanuel Royer taught
%PARI/GP, Adrián Soto presented TeXmacs and gave a talk on Rauzy fractals,
%Janoš Vidali presented DiscreteZOO, Rafael Villarroel presented Emacs,
%Russ Woodroofe gave two talks ("The story of a calculation" and "The story
%of a figure"), Katja Berčič gave a talk on "Databases of theorems", and
%Uziel Silva gave a presentation of Macaulay2, Greuel and Reveal.js.
%
%Many participants told the organisers, orally or by email, that this workshop
%was transformative for them; often they felt they had passed some confidence
%threshold: whereas before the conference they were interested in mathematical
%software but unsure how to install and use them, they were now confident how
%to do that, and felt they had the necessary resources to learn more.
%
%One of the participants who is part of the board of the Mexican Math Society
%initially intended to visit briefly to check out our workshop briefly, and
%ended up staying the whole week, staying at the install party during the free
%afternoon, and got convinced of the importance of having a software component
%in future mathematics conferences in his area. As a result, David Sanders
%gave a course on "numerical methods for dynamical systems", based on Julia,
%at the next national dynamical systems conference in Mexico in June 2018.
%
%Another of the organisers, Katja Berčič, a Slovenian post-doc currently in
%Morelia, Mexico, liked the format of this workshop so much that a new workshop
%on the same format is planned for September 2018 in Koper, Slovenia.
