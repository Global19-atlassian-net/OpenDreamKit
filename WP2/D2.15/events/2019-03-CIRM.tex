\textbf{Main goals.} This was a research conference on the cohomology of
arithmetic groups, with a focus on computational techniques.

\textbf{\ODK implication.} Bill Allombert was invited to give a 1-hour
introduction to PARI/GP for a software session during the conference.
He gave a tutorial on the manipulation of lattices, $L$-functions,
modular forms and curves of small genus in the system.

\ODK participants: B. Allombert from Bordeaux.

\ODK funded the participation of B. Allombert to the event (about 600\euro).

\textbf{Event summary.} This conference took place in Luminy (France)
from March 24th to 29th, with the participation of about 70 mathematicians.

Slides for the PARI/GP presentation are available at
\url{http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/Events/CIRM2019/}

\textbf{Results and impact.} This was a successful teaching and dissemination
event towards a community (arithmetic geometry, representation theory)
for which computer-aided calculations is less natural than in other
areas of mathematics: the talk was well-received with interesting
feedback.
