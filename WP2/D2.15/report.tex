\section{Development workshops}

\TODO{EDIT}
We call a development workshop an event with a restricted number of participants
who meet to work on a specific task. These workshops are an inherent part
of \ODK development process as described in \taskref{dissem}{devel-workshops}:
 they bring together
developers from within and outside of \ODK and allow effective work
and discussions on many technical aspects. They also participate in building
and maintaining a community of developers inside \ODK and within the
open-source communities we belong to.

Throughout years 2 and 3 of the project, we have had 15 workshops dedicated mostly
to development. Some of them also included a training approach.

\section{Dissemination and outreaching activities}

\TODO{EDIT}

We describe here all activities related to \taskref{dissem}{dissemination}:
these are all events oriented towards dissemination, training, and outreach. This
includes events organized or co-organized by \ODK and also
participating in external events and many communication activities.

\subsection{Organization of Sage Days in established mathematical communities}

One goal of \ODK is to support local communities of researchers
and developers who contribute to the open-source software related to
the project. For \Sage, this means supporting the organization of Sage Days
workshops that arise from within all the different mathematical communities. The main 
goal of these workshops is mostly to improve the Sage coverage of some mathematical
area. They also play a major role in training and communication. The
impact for \ODK can be summarized this way:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Making \ODK known to the end users}: by supporting Sage Days,
\ODK makes itself known to the Sage community and can
thus share the many developments of the project.

\item \textbf{Improving the overall quality of Sage}: by fostering researchers
in specific areas, Sage Days help bring interesting mathematics into
the software, which is beneficial for Sage and so \ODK.

\item \textbf{Training, bringing in more users}: Sage Days are the perfect place
for newcomers, especially students, to get their first experience with the software.

\item \textbf{Fostering a community}: Sage Days are helping making Sage a vibrant
community, which is vital for the success of \ODK.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Women in \ODK}

\TODO{EDIT}
\ODK is aware of the gender gap that exists in science in general
and more specifically in software development. We have been organizing
events to support specifically women developers, engineers and scientists.
