# A tentative scenario for an explainer motion graphics video for OpenDreamKit

# Scene 1: Context

Goal: introduce progressively the importance of computers and the
three main elements of the big picture: Data, Knowledge, Software

### Sequence 1&2: long standing and booming role of computers in pure mathematics

Voice: mathematicians have always worked on mechanizing calculations
Visual:
- portrait of the inventor of the concept of algorithm (al-Khwarizmi)
- the Babbage machine and Ada Lovelace, with some mathematical algorithm she may have written?

Voice: they used early mechanical devices and computers
Visual: example of calculation with one of the early computing devices?
Visuals: proving the 4 color theorem (visual), the kepler conjecture

Visual: discovering new mathematics
Voice: the computer has become their *telescope* (visual)


Voice: Nowadays, computers are involved in all aspects of mathematical research:
- Computing
- Collaborative work on knowledge (wikipedia, arxiv; maybe overleaf?)
- ...

Visual:
- building progressively the [big picture](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/blob/master/Proposal/Pictures/TheBigPicture.svg) by adding the logos one by
  one, possibly along with brief screenshot flashes of wikipedia, ...
- maybe: motion graphics showing the flow of collaboration?


### Sequence 3: Emergence of a vibrant ecosystem of free software for pure mathematics

To support their needs mathematicians and the community at large have
developed a wide ecosystem of tools for:

- Software (computing: GAP, ...; proofs: ...)
- Data (lmfdb, ...)
- Collaborating on software
- Mathematical Knowledge Management

Visual: logos? / screenshots?

### Sequence 4: linking with Open Science

What's open science; this was made possible by the ideas of Open
Science, ...

### Scene 2

### Sequence 1: The next frontier: Virtual Research Environments?

- Visual: definition + mentioning the call

### Sequence 2: an example of VRE: the Virtual Observatory

  Visual: Screencast of the Virtual Observatory in action

  Voice: astrophysicists across the world have come together over the
  last decade and decided to build together the Virtual Observatory,
  an amazing web site where any one can point to any location on the
  sky and get immediate access to any data that has been recorded
  there.

### Sequence 3: VRE for mathematics? Requirements

(see slides)

Goal: motivate the VRE toolkit idea
Visuals: motion graphics on the big picture illustrating each use case below.

Note: this is where the physical resources enter the big picture

Use cases:

- a researcher wants to set up a VRE using one computational software,
  using physical resources from his lab, to collaborate with some
  colleagues.

- an institution (e.g. a university) wants to provide access to a
  range of computational software to its members, using local compute
  and storage resources

- a researcher wants to publish the logbook of some experiments, as a
  live document

- a teacher has setup on his machine en environment combining several
  tools, and wants to let his student work in the same environment

- all the above for large area of mathematics

Conclusion: there is no one-size-fits all solution; instead we want a
*toolkit* enabling people to flexibly compose software, data and
physical resources to build their own VRE, tailored to their needs.


Visual transition: just a dream?

Scene 3: Jupyter to the rescue

Visuals: screencasts of Jupyter in action with widgets, app-mode, ...

Key ideas: Jupyter provides a very flexible interactive environment that

- supports a huge array of computational and data management tools
  (visual: flip through logo's of Python, C++, R, ...)
- live documents, logbooks, applications, ...
- empowers beginners as well as advanced user alike
- fosters reproducibility, ...


## Scene 4 : Tasks and achievements

Visuals all along this scene: adding the deliverables on the big
picture, as in page 19 of those
[slides](https://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-04-26-ProjectReviewPresentations/overview.pdf).

### WP3: Technical composability and portability

Voice: improve software and best practices to make software easier to
compose and run on a variety of platforms
Visual: some more motion graphics on the big picture

### WP4: User interface

Voice: TODO: Something about Jupyter, composing all our software with Jupyter, easing VRE deployments
Visual: some motion graphic on the big picture + possibly some screenshots / KPI about deployments

### WP5: High Performance Mathematical Computing

Voice: TODO: improving the computational software for high performance on modern architectures
Visual: some motion graphic on the big picture

### WP6:

Key idea: Math-in-the-Middle: use Knowledge to make Data and Software more composable

Concrete use case: a user wants to build a VRE combining GAP and Sage and some data set in lmfdb

Voice: TODO
Visual: motion graphic on the big picture illustrating the Math-in-the-Middle

### WP2: dissemination

Voice: TODO
Visual: TODO

### Transition:

Voice: This still all looks very bold?
Visual ?

## Scene 6: Strategy & conclusion

Voice: thanks to the power of open source, we are part of a huge community working collaboratively

Voice: which we engaged in the project since the conception of the proposal

Visual: illustrate the open spirit and process, maybe with this [gource vid√©o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9zcfRtOqo) of the proposal writing ?

Voice: We focus on identifying hurdles and use the means provided by
EU funding to concentrate manpower to help knock them down and let the
ball rolling (and steer it along the way!)

Visual: motion graphic illustrating the above
