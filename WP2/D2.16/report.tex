\section Executive summary

The present document constitutes Deliverable D2.16 (Press Release) in the framework of WP2
(Community Building, Training, Dissemination, Exploitation, and Outreach), regarding Tasks 2.1 
(Dissemination and Communication activities). Press releases are an important 
part of our communication stategy. With the press releases we plan to call
attention of multiple audiences about our research in a way understandable
by non-specialists and address the EU perspective of research and innovation 
funding, by considering some aspects such as the European transnational 
cooperation in the consortium and the scientific excellence with a better use
of results to the scientific community.

During the first months of the project, we have covered 6 press releases and we
planned to do the same at the end to promote the actions and the results by providing
targeted information to broad audience ( including the media and the public).
First we will submit a general communication about the project on our website presenting 
the results of the assessment made by the referees and the Project Officers during our 
final review meeting.

\section{Collaborative process}

The press releases will be the result of a joint effort of the partners who are actively
involved in the promotion of the press releases; their collective effort will result in
at least 12 releases in general press in the high education, research area and local press.
We also followed the bottom up aprroach even to prepare the article that was written completely
in the open. % insérer schéma

\section{Communication tools and channels}

\Subsection Project website and social media channels

The ODK website (https://opendreamkit.org/) served as a major dissemination tool in terms of 
project’s concept, objectives and outcomes. It provides information on the project content,
objectives,  partners,  planned activities, events organized within the project and deliverables.

We also plan to use the website to submit a second type of communicative released 
information that will present more specificall the results achieved in the project.

major achievements and milestones of the project. It will be released and published in 
the project website and delivered to mass media. This article will be written by Upsud 
with the technical contribution of the ODK partners.
