\section{End of project press releases}

During the first months of the project we had published six press
releases and we had planned to do the same at the end to promote the
actions and the results by providing targeted information to broad
audience (including the media and the public).


The press releases are the result of a joint effort of the partners,
which followed our usual open bottom up approach.

Some of the beneficiaries, including the coordinator, reached to their
Press Office to inquire about adequate forms and processes. Based on
our Summary for Publication, UPSud's Press Office proposed a quick
draft in French as source of inspiration. The coordinator then lead
the collective writing of a general joint text. This text served as
template that each beneficiary could adapt to suit its own
circumstances and translate into the local language as required. The
produced press releases were then circulated to the respective press
or communication offices, which should lead to about twelve releases.

% , leading to at least 12 releases in general press in the high
% education, research area, and local press.

\section{End of project communication through OpenDreamKit's channels}

OpenDreamKit's website (\url{https://opendreamkit.org/}) served as a
major dissemination tool in terms of project’s concept, objectives and
outcomes. It provides information on the project content, objectives,
partners, planned activities, events organized within the project and
deliverables. It's complemented by a
\href{https://twitter.com/OpenDreamKit}{@OpenDreamKit} Twitter
account, and a video channel. Both serve as direct communication
instrument to reach the general public and interact with other
communities such as GAP, SageMath, Cocalc, or Jupyter.

During the project, seven video interviews were created to communicate
about the project, its main goals and the consortium to a wider
public; and 3 explainer videos that tell the story of our project in a
way understandable for a non scientific public. The videos will be
used across online platforms, and promoted through the project’s
online communications channels such as YouTube. A Youtube account for
OpenDreamKit project was set up to host the video series. The number
of views, and comments for each video were monitored as KPIs in the
technical report.

On the day after the final review meeting, we published a
\href{https://opendreamkit.org/2019/10/30/final-project-review/}{blog post}
on our website highlighting our presentations and the assessment made
by the referees and the Project Officers.

An overview of the project outcomes was produced by UPSud with the
technical contribution of the ODK partners (see appendix XXX), and
will be published on OpenDreamKit's web site; it takes the form of an
extended version of the Summary for Publication produced at the
occasion the last reporting period. It complements the press release
by being more detailed on the concrete actions and the impact on end
users, with link to related material (reports, blog posts, ...). Soon
after its publication, a blog about the future of OpenDreamKit
community will posted, and both will be advertised through social
media (twitter, ...). We also plan to launch targeted email campaigns
in order to reach to our scientific communities about the significant
developments on ODK project activities and results.


% In order to reach a broad target, the presence of the ODK project in social media was
% also encouraged. 

% The website will have direct access to these social networks by clicking over the icon 
% situated on a visible part of the website. In this way, it will be easy for every user 
% to participate in this when the website is visited.

\subsection{End of project communication through the European Commission's channels}

The Coordinator has contacted the communication officer  who will support the dissemination
of the results of the project ad will promote them through the EC's communication channels. 
The communication officer will publish an article and a presentation of the project in the 
newsletter ” Digital Excellence \& Science Infrastructure “ of the European Commission, 
on the European Commission website \url{https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/} to reach 
a wider audience, potentiating it outreach. 
HORIZON, the EU Research \& Innovation e-magazine, will also be used to inform about 
the benefits and progress that ODK will generate in Europe, informing about 
the open debates created and the results.
