\section Executive summary

Press releases were included in the Workpackage 2 and are an important 
part of our communication stategy. With the press releases we plan to call
attention of multiple audiences about our research in a way understandable
by non-specialists and address the EU perspective of research and innovation 
funding, by considering some aspects such as the European transnational 
cooperation in the consortium and the scientific excellence with a better use
of results to the scientific community.

During the first months of the project, we have covered 6 press releases and we
planned to do the same at the end to promote the actions and the results by providing
targeted information to boroad audience ( including the media and the public).
First will  submit a general communication about the project on our website presenting 
the results of the assessment made by the referees and the Project Officers during our 
final review meeting.


 Several partners have been actively involved in the promotion of the press releases; their collective effort resulted in at least 20 news in local or specialized online magazines.
