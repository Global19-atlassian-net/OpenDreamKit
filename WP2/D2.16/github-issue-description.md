This deliverable briefly reviews the efforts of the consortium within Work Package 2 (Community Building, Training, Dissemination, Exploitation, and Outreach) to communicate the outcomes of the project to the broader audience. This includes the production of Press Releases, an important part of our communication strategy. The aim is to call attention of multiple audiences about our research in a way understandable by non-specialists. It also is to address the EU perspective of research and innovation funding, by considering some aspects such as the European transnational cooperation in the consortium and the scientific excellence with a better use of results to the scientific community.

Under the leadership of the coordinating institution (UPSud), the beneficiaries prepared collectively a joint text. This text served as template that each beneficiary could adapt to suit its own circumstances and translate into the local language as required. The produced press releases were then circulated to the respective press or communication offices in early December 2019. This also includes other forms of end-of-project communication through publications in EC and non EC channels, OpenDreamKit's web site, community mailing lists, and social media.

TODO (not to be included in the final deliverable report):

Press releasing process:
- **CONTACT** the Press Office or Communication department of your institution (to identify if the topic is suitable for a press release or not, or if there is another way to get media attention such as Press article published in the University website or through the newsletter). Best deadline: Next week.

- **TOPIC APPROVAL** by the Communication Department/ Press Office, **deadline 15 days before the publication**.   

- **WRITING**: The press officer is usually in charge of writing the press release and distribute it to the general mainstream press. The content has to be easy to communicate to journalists. The UPSud communication department is preparing a general text that you will receive and could adapt at your convenience. 

- **RELEASING**: The approved release will then be sent to relevant journalists contacts of your institution ( general press in the high education, research area and local press) and uploaded to newswire services. Deadline for publication (to negociate with your respective communication departments): **before the Review meeting**.

TODO ( Contact Press offices to plan a Press release)
