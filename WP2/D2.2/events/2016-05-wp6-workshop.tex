\begin{event}{WP6 Workshop (Bremen)}{wp6-1}{Bremen, Germany, 2016-05-30 to 2016-06-03}{JU, SA, PS}{7}{}

\textbf{Main goals.} Work meeting to understand the type systems of \GAP and
SAGE, and to develop a first interface between MMT, \GAP, and \Sage.

\textbf{ODK implication.} \ODK through Jacobs Uni Bremen was the main
organizer of this event to work on WP6. \PS participated remotely.

\textbf{Event summary.} The event featured a talk about the GAP type
system, and many discussions between the researchers in Bremen and
Markus Pfeiffer. We developed a substantial piece of software to
enable GAP to interface with MMT. Meanwhile \site{PS}, with the
support of \site{SA} and \site{JU}, made further progress on
\delivref{component-architecture}{semantic-interface-sage-gap} and on
the export of the math knowledge embedded in \Sage.

\textbf{Results and impact.}  This workshop was essential to ODK WP6,
in particular for \longtaskref{dksbases}{data-design} and
\delivref{dksbases}{design}.
