\begin{event}{Conference Combinatoire, Algèbre et Théorie des Nombres}{2016CATN}{Monastir, Tunisia -- 24-28 Mars 2016}{UB}{30}{http://www.edsf.fss.rnu.tn/Colloque1/colloque3.html}

\textbf{Main goals.}
CTAN 2016 was a mathematical conference that took place in Tunisia.
The first goal of ODK was to make an initiation on SageMath. 
The second goal was to create a sage developer team in Tunisia.

\textbf{ODK implication.} A. Boussicault was sent by ODK to give a lesson on
SageMath. ODK paid the travel and accommodation of A. Boussicault.

\textbf{Event summary.}
Each intervention was 2 hours long. There was one intervention per day during 
a week. 
The lessons were conducted on participants' computers.
We worked with Sage by using a Debian live USB key.

All the evening, we made Linux installfests on partipant's laptops. 
The evening sessions were beginning at 20:30 and ended at midnight.

The lesson was presented by A. Boussicault (University of Bordeaux) and 
Imad Eddine Bousbaa (University of USTHB of Algeria). We met Imad during a 
previous conference in Algeria.
The purpose was to present and make mathematical calculus with Sage.
We made also some python lessons and Combinatorics lessons.

During that event, we discussed with CTAN organizers and some researchers 
to organize some important mathematical events in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and
Lebanon.
Many researchers were present in the discussion. For example, there were 
Professor H. Belbachir (University USTHB in Alger), 
Professor I. Boudabbous (University of Sfax in Tunisia)
Professor O. Khadir (University Hassan II of Casablanca),
Professor M. Pouzet (University of Lyon1),
professor H. Kheddouci, (University of Lyon1).
We decided to organize, in the next year, an event with the mathematical 
conference CTAN followed by mathematical schools and some sage Days.
In the school, we could make some Sage lessons and we could implement ideas 
and mathematical tools during the sage days.

\textbf{Demographic.} 30 participants. CTAN is an international conference. 
The people came from Lebanon, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, etc. 

\textbf{Results and impact.}
The will to organize an event with a mathematical conference 
followed by mathematical schools, and sage Days in Morocco or in Algeria.

We made some Tunisian contacts to create a developer team in University of 
Sfax.
