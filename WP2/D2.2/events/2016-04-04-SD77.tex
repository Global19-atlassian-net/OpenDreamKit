\begin{event}{Sage Days 77: packaging, portability, documentation tools}{sd77}{Cernay (France) 2016-04-04 to 2016-04-04}{PS,UV,LL}{15}{https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77}

  \textbf{Main goals.} This developer meeting was focused on
  initiating long term work on ODK tasks related to packaging,
  portability and documentation tools for SageMath.

  \textbf{ODK implication.} This event was organized and funded by
  Paris Sud.

  \textbf{Event summary.} An intensive week with some short informal
  presentations, and many brainstorms and coding sprints.

  \textbf{Demographic.} 9 ODK participants from three sites together
  with half a dozen other Sage, Sphinx, Guix, Gentoo, and Debian
  experts.

  \textbf{Results and impact.} Proper packaging and distribution has
  been a recurrent issue for SageMath, and is a major task for ODK
  (\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/52}{T3.3:
    Modularisation and packaging}). Major brainstorms occurred during
  the week to clarify the needs, isolate the core difficulties, and
  explore potential approaches to tackle them. The outcome was posted
  on the \href{https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77/packaging}{Sage Wiki},
  to be shared and further edited by the community. This fostered
  tighter collaboration between the packaging efforts for various
  Linux distribution, and triggered major progress on the Debian
  packaging side.

  Similar brainstorms and coding sprints occurred around tasks

  Altogether

    Sage tickets} were actively worked on during the week.
