\section{Project meetings and development workshops}
~

We call a development workshop an event with a restricted number of participants
who meet to work on a specific task. These workshops are an inherent part
of OpenDreamKit development process as described in \href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/26}{T2.3}:
 they bring together
developers from within and outside of OpenDreamKit and allow for effective work
and discussions on many technical aspects. They also participate in building
and maintaining a community of developers inside OpenDreamKit and within the
open-source communities we belong to.

We list here all workshops which have been organized or co-organized by OpenDreamKit
as well as external workshops which have been attended by OpenDreamKit participants
with a significant impact on the project. We also include Project meetings as they
participate to the same goal of bringing together participants of the project and
always include some development time.

Throughout the first year of the project, we have had
\begin{itemize}
\item 3 project meetings,
\item 2 workshops fully funded and organized by OpenDreamKit,
\item 2 workshops partially funded and co-organized by OpenDreamKit,
\item 1 external workshop.
\end{itemize}
This includes in particular one development Sage Days and one Atelier
Pari that we had announced on \href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/26}{T2.3}.
 These events had a major impact on other OpenDreamKit tasks and workpackages: WP3:

\section{Dissemination and outreaching activities}

We describe here all activities related to \href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/28}{T2.5},
these are all events oriented towards dissemination, training, and outreach. This
includes events organized or co-organized by OpenDreamKit and also
participating in external events and many communication activities.

\subsection{Organization of Sage Days in established mathematical communities}
~

One goal of OpenDreamKit is to support local communities of researchers
and developers who contribute to the open-source softwares related to
the project. For Sage, this means supporting the organization of Sage-Days
workshops that arise from within all the different mathematical communities. The main 
goal of these workshops is mostly to improve the Sage coverage of some mathematical
area. They also play a major role in training and communication. The
impact for OpenDreamKit can be summarized this way:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Making ODK known to the end users}: by supporting Sage Days,
OpenDreamKit makes itself known to the Sage community and can
thus share the many developments of the project.

\item \textbf{Improving the overall quality of Sage}: by fostering researchers
in specific areas, Sage Days help bring interesting mathematics into
the software, which is beneficial for Sage and so OpenDreamKit.

\item \textbf{Training, bringing more user}: Sage Days are the perfect place
for new comers, especially students, to get their first experience with the software.

\item \textbf{Fostering a community}: Sage Days are helping making Sage a vibrant
community, which is vital for the success of OpenDreamKit.
\end{itemize}

Throughout the first year of the project, OpenDreamKit has been organizing or co-organizing
3 Sage Days: one about geometry and dynamics of surfaces, one in differential geometry and topology
 and one in combinatorics.
