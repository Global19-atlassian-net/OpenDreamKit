An important part of the success of the ODK project is linked to its
ability to \textbf{foster a community} in the spirit of the open source
projects it is built on. Part of this relies on the organization and
participation to scientific and development events of many different
scales and objectives. In this deliverable, we give a first overview of
the actions taken during the first year of the project. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Organization of development workshops
\item
  Organization of dissemination workshops in different thematic linked
  to ODK
\item
  Training intervention in external events
\item
  Communication interventions and participation to external events
\item
  Actions taken to foster a community in developing countries
\end{itemize}

We describe each event with its specific goals and explain the exact
implication of ODK in the organization and realization of the event. We
give a general overview of the impact of single events, thus drawing a
first draft of ODK impact as a whole, and describe future directions for
the years to come.
