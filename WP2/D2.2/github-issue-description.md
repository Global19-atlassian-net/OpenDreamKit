- **Final report:** in the making

An important part of the success of the ODK project is linked to its ability to **foster a community** in the spirit of the open source projects it is built on. Part of this relies on the organization and participation to scientific and development events of many different scales and objectives. In this deliverable, we give a first overview of the actions taken during the first year of the project. This includes:

* Organization of development workshops 
* Organization of dissemination workshops in different thematic linked to ODK 
* Training intervention in external events 
* Communication interventions and participation to external events
* Actions taken to foster a community in developing countries

We describe each event with its specific goals and explain the exact implication of ODK in the organization and realization of the event. We give a general overview of the impact of single events, thus drawing a first draft of ODK impact as a whole, and describe future directions for the years to come.
