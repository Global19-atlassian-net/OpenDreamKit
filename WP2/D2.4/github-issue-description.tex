SageMathCloud is both an open source software project
(\url{https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc}) and an online instance of
that software (\url{https://cloud.sagemath.com/}) that provides an
interactive, collaborative environment for teaching and research in
science, technology, engineering and mathematics. SageMathCloud is used
in teaching all over the world and a selection of courses utilising it
can be found at \url{https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/wiki/Teaching}.

In this deliverable, we have developed a short course for educators who
wish to adopt this technology in order to enhance their teaching.
Produced in collaboration with SageMathCloud developers and the wider
community, the result is a website that can easily co-evolve with the
technology it describes.
