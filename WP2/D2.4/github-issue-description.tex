SageMathCloud is both an open source software project
(\url{https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc}) and an online instance of
that software (hosted at \url{https://cloud.sagemath.com/}) that
provides an interactive, collaborative environment for teaching and
research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
SageMathCloud is used in teaching all over the world and a selection of
courses utilising it can be found at
\url{https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/wiki/Teaching}. SageMathCloud
predates OpenDreamKit and acts as prototypical example of VRE that can
be built from the ecosystem OpenDreamKit aims at fostering; hence we are
working in close collaboration with its development team.

In this deliverable, we have developed a short course for educators who
wish to adopt this technology in order to enhance their teaching.
Produced in collaboration with SageMathCloud developers and the wider
community, the result is a website
(\url{https://mikecroucher.github.io/SMC_tutorial/}) that can easily
co-evolve with the technology it describes.
