SageMathCloud is both an open source software project (https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc) and an online instance of that software (https://cloud.sagemath.com/) that provides an interactive, collaborative environment for teaching and research in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. SageMathCloud is used in teaching all over the world and a selection of courses utilising it can be found at https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/wiki/Teaching.

In this deliverable, we have developed a short course for educators who wish to adopt this technology in order to enhance their teaching. Produced in collaboration with SageMathCloud developers and the wider community, the result is a website that can easily co-evolve with the technology it describes.
