\section{A Joint Perspective and Generalization of Jupyter and Active
  Documents}\label{sec:comparison}

We will now highlight the features of the ADP and Jupyter notebooks with a view towards a
possible unification of the systems.

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \caption{Active Documents}\label{fig:graph2}
\end{figure}

\emph{Active Documents} need a Player process (e.g. the Planetary system) that makes them
executable, gives access to provenance and copyright/licensing information, and supports
various forms of validation. Figure~\ref{fig:graph2} shows the situation in analogy to
Figure~\ref{fig:activedocs}: On the left we see an active document -- a web page in a
browser -- as it is seen by the user: it contains text interspersed with regions that are
interactive because they have been bound to semantic services, which are executed by the
player system -- in the middle -- that interprets the represented content structures --
the mathematical knowledge; here depicted by a theory graph on the right.


In \emph{Jupyter} the situation is similar, the user interacts with a dynamic web page --
the Jupyter notebook interface -- in a browser that is a mathematical text interspersed
with areas of interactivity: the computation cells. These can generate mathematical
content and righ media output into the notebook upon user request. We see the notebook
interface on the left of Figure~\ref{fig:graph3}. Again, we have a ``player process'' the
Jupyter system and displays the text from the notebook and the computational kernel that
runs the code for the notebook. Note that the notebook (source) is also a representation
of mathematical knowledge; we see it on the right of Figure~\ref{fig:graph3}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \input{JupyterRepresentation}
  \caption{Jupyter Communication}\label{fig:graph3}
\end{figure}

This already hints at a synthesis of the two systems; we make this explicit in
Figure~\ref{fig:graph4}: We build a combined player system that combines the complementary
features of both systems. 

On the \emph{user interface} side this combined player 
\begin{compactenum}
\item allows free-form mathematical documents with interactivity regions like in active
  documents, but also 
\item provides computational cells with read-eval-print style interaction with dedicated
  computational machines.
\end{compactenum}
We have tried to indicate this in the mixed user interface in Figure~\ref{fig:graph3}. 

On \emph{the computational side}, it combines
\begin{compactenum}
\item the generic semantic services of the MMT Tool based with
\item dedicated computational machines running code in separate kernel processes. 
\end{compactenum}
Note that all of these need to share a notion of ``mathematical state'' so that the user
interface can present a consistent view to the user.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \input{Syntesis}
  \caption{Jupyter combined with Active Documents}\label{fig:graph4}
\end{figure}

The new player process relies on the availability of three ``declarative compondens'' that
also need to be in a consistent representation. 
\begin{compactenum}
\item mathematical document text 
\item theory-graph shaped content representations, and 
\item engine-specific code 
\end{compactenum}
We will call these tri-partite representations that combine the parts of Jupyter notebooks
and OMDoc documents \textbf{OpenDreamKit Notebooks}.
