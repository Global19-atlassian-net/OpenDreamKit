\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

One of the most prominent features of a virtual research environment (VRE) is a unified
user interface. The \pn approach is to create a mathematical VRE by integrating various
pre-existing mathematical software systems. There are two approaches that can serve as a
basis for the \pn UI: ``computational notebooks'' and ``active documents''. The former
allow mathematical text around the computation cells of a real-eval-print loop of a
mathematical software system and the latter make semantically annotated documents
semantic.
  
We report on two systems in the \pn project: Jupyter\cite{jupyter-project:on} -- a
notebook server for various kernels, and MathHub.info -- a platform for active
mathematical documents. We identify commonalities and differences and develop a vision for
integrating their functionalitities.
  
The report is organized as follows: Sections~\ref{sec:jupyter} and~\ref{sec:active}
introduce the two systems individually. Section~\ref{sec:comparison} relates them under a
common perspective and uses that to develop a vison of a joint generalization that
combines the advantages. Section~\ref{sec:concl} concludes the report.
