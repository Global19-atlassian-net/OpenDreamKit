+\begin{task}[title=Knowledge-based code infrastructure, id=research-categories,lead=PS,partners={ZH,JU},PM=33,wphases=12-48]
+  Over the last decades, computational components, and in particular
+  Axiom, MuPAD, \GAP, or \Sage, have embedded more and more
+  mathematical knowledge directly inside the code, as a way to better
+  structure it for expressiveness, flexibility, composability,
+  documentation, and robustness. In this task we will review the
+  various approaches taken in these software (e.g. categories and
+  dynamic class hierarchies) and in proof assistants like Coq
+  (e.g. static type systems), and compare their respective strength
+  and weaknesses on concrete case studies. We will also explore
+  whether paradigms offered by recent programming languages like Julia
+  or Scala could enable a better implementation. Based on this we will
+  suggest and experiment with design improvements, and explore
+  challenges such as the compilation, verification, or
+  interoperability of such code.
