\section{An application: toward multi-system semantic aware handle interfaces}

\subsection{The handle paradigm in system interfaces}\label{the-handle-paradigm-in-system-interfaces}

The ``handle'' paradigm has become a classic when interfacing two
computational mathematics systems. For example, most of the \Sage
interfaces, including that for \GAP, \Singular, or \Pari use this
paradigm to delegate calculations to those systems.

In this paradigm, when a system \texttt{A} delegates a calculation to a
system \texttt{B}, the result \texttt{r} of the calculation is not
converted to a native \texttt{A} object; instead \texttt{B} just returns
a handle (or reference) to the object \texttt{r}. Later \texttt{A} can
run further calculations with \texttt{r} by passing it as argument to
\texttt{B} functions or methods. Advantages of this approach include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Avoiding the overhead of back and forth conversions between
  \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}.
\item Manipulating objects of \texttt{B} from \texttt{A} even if they
  have no native representation in \texttt{A}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Semantic handle interfaces}\label{semantic-handle-interfaces}

Whenever \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} share some common semantic (for example the concept of
group), it's desirable that handles behave as native \texttt{A} objects. For example, if a
group \texttt{G} is constructed in \texttt{B}, one wants to manipulate handles to
\texttt{G} or its elements as if they were native \texttt{A} groups or group elements,
even if there is no corresponding native implementation for \texttt{G} in \texttt{A}.
This can be achieved with the usual \emph{adapter} design pattern. The bulk of the work is
the implementation of adapter methods so that, for example, calling the method
\texttt{h.cardinality()} on a \Sage handle \texttt{h} to a \GAP object \texttt{G},
triggers in \GAP a call to \texttt{Size(G)}.

In \Sage, this has been implemented in a couple special cases. For
examples, \Sage permutation groups or matrix groups are built on top
of handles to \GAP objects. However, this implementation is monolithic
and does not scale. For example, if \texttt{h} is a handle to a set
\texttt{S}, \Sage only knows that \texttt{h.cardinality()} can be
computed by \texttt{Size(S)} in \GAP if \texttt{S} is a group; in fact
if \texttt{h} has been constructed through the
\texttt{PermutationGroup} or \texttt{MatrixGroup}
constructors. Whereas we would want this method to be available as
soon as \texttt{S} is a set.

\subsection{Generic/hierarchical semantic handle interfaces}\label{generichierarchical-semantic-handle-interfaces}

During the \href{http://gapdays.de/gap-sage-days2016/}{first joint
  \GAP-\Sage days}, the last author worked on a prototype of generic
semantic handle \Sage-\GAP interface. The idea is twofold:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item Every \Sage category (\emph{e.g.}\ the category of sets, of groups) can
  provide a collection of adapter methods that are valid for every
  handle to a \GAP object in the corresponding mathematical category.
  This applies as well to elements and morphisms.
\item When a handle \texttt{h} to a \GAP object \texttt{S} is created,
  the properties of \texttt{S} (its \GAP categories and properties)
  are explored, and the handle \texttt{h} is then put in the matching
  (or closest matching) \Sage category.
\end{enumerate}

For example, here is the adapter for the cardinality method and some
context around:
\begin{lstlisting}
class Sets: # Everything about sets in Sage
    class GAP: # The adapter methods relevant to Sets in the Sage-Gap interface
         class ParentMethods: # Adapter methods for sets
             def cardinality(self): # The adapter for the cardinality method
                 return self.gap().Size().sage()
         class ElementMethods: # Adapter methods for set elements
             ...
         class MorphismMethods: # Adapter methods for set morphisms
             ...
\end{lstlisting}

At the current stage of the implementation, a handle to a \GAP field
behaves essentially like a native \Sage field. This remains valid for
objects of all subcategories as well, from magmas to rings. The
infrastructure is relatively lightweight, and can be extended by
developers and users as the need for more adapter methods arises.

\subsection{Scaling to multisystem interfaces?}\label{scaling-to-multisystem-interfaces}

A second stage was initiated during the
\href{http://opendreamkit.org/2015/12/08/WP6StAndrewsMeeting/}{Knowledge
representation in mathematical software and databases workshop}
organized at the University of St Andrews, St Andrews, 25th-27th
January, 2016.

The approach described earlier is likely to work well for implementing
an interface between two systems. However it does not scale for
interfacing \texttt{n} systems, as this requires the implementation of
\texttt{n(n-1)} independent adapter interfaces.

The key point here is that implementing an adapter method (or
function) typically requires only some simple abstract information on
the method, namely its signature and its names in both systems.  In
particular, the only things that changes between an \texttt{A->B}
adapter method and the equivalent \texttt{C->D} adapter method are the
names of the methods.

The second stage of this project is therefore to explore whether the
interfaces could be automatically generated from a consistent
formalizations of the systems.

\ednote{NT:Update this paragraph w.r.t. the rest of this section}

Ideally, the mathematical structure and operations would be described
once, \emph{e.g.}\ in the MMT language (the blue blob in Michael's talk) and
then each system would be formalized by specifying how the operations
are implemented (the purple blobs). For example, one would specify in
MMT that a magma is a set with a binary operation denoted by default
\texttt{o}. The relevant category in \Sage is \texttt{Magmas()}, and
the binary operation is implemented by the method \texttt{\_mul\_}.

We experimented with doing this formalization using lightweight
annotations in the \Sage source code such as:
\begin{lstlisting}
@semantic(mmt="sets")
class Sets:
    class ParentMethods:
         @semantic(mmt="o", gap="Size")
         @abstractmethod
         def cardinality(self):
             r"""
             Return the cardinality of ``self``.
             """
\end{lstlisting}
Note: the only additions to the original source code are the \texttt{@semantic} lines.

Several variants of the annotations exist to allow for adding
annotations on existing categories without touching their file, and also
for specifying directly the corresponding method names in other systems
when this has not yet been formalized elsewhere. Similarly, one could
provide directly the signature information in case that is not yet
modelled in MMT.

\subsection{Difficulties}\label{difficulties}

In \Sage and \GAP (and most other systems with some category mechanism) we distinguish
additive magma and multiplicative magma, duplicating all the information, code, etc. In
MMT however, thanks to morphisms which allow to rename operations transparently, there is
no such distinction: there are just Magmas.

Hence, to actually map additive magmas in \Sage to additive magmas in \GAP (and map the
corresponding methods), one need in the intermediate MMT step to keep an extra bit of
information, namely whether the monoid is additive or multiplicative (or something else;
think of the bracket operation of Lie algebras).
