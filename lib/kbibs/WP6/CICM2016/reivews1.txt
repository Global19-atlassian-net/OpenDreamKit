----------- Review -----------
This paper describes a new project to integrate various heterogeneous mathematical software systems and resources to provide a single service. The proposed approach uses an expressive (apparently set- and logic-based) formalism as the "Math-in-the-Middle" to be able to pass computational information from one service to another. Attendees at CICM will almost certainly be interested in this project, and perhaps some will wish to contribute to it over the next several years.

Unfortunately there is no related work section included in the description in order to place the proposal in context. Are there no existing computational math interface services or attempts for at least a couple of resources? Surely there are at least some primitive expression-based services for connecting systems via MathML or OpenMath. Furthermore, the basic idea of providing integrated services has been adopted in many fields, and the fundamental architecture based on "mediators" together with their associated "wrappers" or "adapters" per service is well-understood and should be referenced [1].

Around p. 2, it would be very informative to include a worked-out example of the sort of facility that the system will eventually provide, e.g., to "make it easy for a specialist of scientific computing to use tools from pure mathematics, and reciprocally." This should not include how the conversions are accomplished, but rather serve as a feasible example of how the integrated service could be used by a researcher in mathematics.

What is the effort involved in creating the interface theories? Can this be somehow characterized in general, or perhaps (e.g., using time as a measure of effort) by illustration based on the example included in the paper? Does the approach require that every piece of the source system be translated individually and statically inserted into the wrapper? If a new component is added to the source (an update), does a corresponding new component need to be added manually to the interface, or does the interface somehow provide a mechanism for automatic updates to incorporate new translations from an existing source? (In other words, is the wrapper in fact a complete re-implementation of the source functionality in the MitM language, or is a run-time translator that runs between the source and the mediator?)

The choice of the term "interviews" is unfortunate because the common meaning of that word is not based on "inter-views". If a better term cannot be found, perhaps the inclusion of a hyphen would help a reader by reducing the inclination to misunderstand the term.

Why are work packages 1 and 2 not included in the list of tasks on p. 3?

Throughout the paper is would be better to reduce the use of acronyms. For example, the paper is unnecessarily difficult to read because of the extensive use of "VRE" and "COMs" as well as the many other acronyms.

p.6 "Details" -> "Detail"
p.11 "40k" -> "40,000"
p.12 "to accesses" -> "to access"
p.13 "an interface the for" -> "an interface for"
p.14 "be adopted" -> "being adopted"
p.14 "an contribute" -> "and contribute"

----------- Review -----------
This paper introduces the EU-funded project OpenDreamKit project  and details its "Math-in-
the-Middle (MitM) approach for ensuring a virtual research environment for mathematicians. 

The paper reads like an executive project summary, motivating and detailing the goals of OpenDreamKit and MitM in particular. There are two case studies presented in the paper - the semantic interface between GAP and Sage was quite an interesting one. The project is still its early stages, which explains that they are only initial case studies to be reported about. Overall, the paper is well-written and it would be interesting to get this project presented and discussed at CICM.  
The paper could be improved with an overview of similar efforts in the area.

I find it hard to write any more comments/suggestions about the project, and cannot provide a "scientific" review here. 
The project has potential (the goals are too ambitious), but it is hard to evaluate project ideas and research directions. 
I found the paper interesting, without much scientific contributions. But as a submission to the project track of CICM, the paper fills its goals.

----------- Review -----------
This paper provides an overview (with examples) of a so-named "Math-in-the-Middle" approach to making an ecosystem of mathematical support tools interoperable.  At the moment the focus is on CAS-style tools (e.g. SAGE, GAP) rather than provers.

The technical and formal sections of the paper seem quite well put together.  The exposition is clear, and the topic is relevant to CICM.  My only objection was to a couple of early sections that give high-level details on the OpenDreamKit project.  For this reviewer, these sections were not high-level enough.  I would recommend to summarise the OpenDreamKit project much more briefly in these early sections, which could save 1 or 2 pages which could then be used to expand the technical and formal points in the rest of the paper.

I've added some specific minor comments per page below.

NB. Although quite readable, the paper includes some non-standard constructions in English. I have not marked all of these, just given one or two examples.  Please copyedit the final submission.

p. 1

Abstract - margin overflow in 1st line

"WP6"
- seems slightly too specific for outside world to care about

"This information architecture..."
- Are you sure that Math-in-the-Middle is an information architecture?

"does not count online services like Wikipedia"
- why not, specifically?

p. 2

"Lowering barriers between research communities and promote dissemination."
- maybe you should use the gerund "promoting" here

"the developers communities"
- developer communities

"Outsourcing as much of the development as possible"
- is this a "critical long term investment"?  Seems more like a "goal".  How will it work?

"These can be subsumed by the goal of Virtual Research Environments"
- I'm not sure I totally believe this claim, vis a vis the long-term/large-scale outreach items.

p. 3

Again, I'm not sure that listing the workpackages of the OpenDreamKit project helps me understand the scientific contributions of the current paper.

"documentation tools, ..."
- is the ... intentional or is the sentence unfinished?

"data archiving and sharing in a semantically sound way component architecture"
- I'm not sure what this is intending to say

"software/-"
- I'm not sure the "-" is needed, how about just "software\slash "?

After reading Section 2, "The OpenDreamKit Project", I wonder how much of this background could be skipped or compressed so that we could get on with Section 3.  It seems the key idea needed is "VRE".  I'm not sure that Section 2 provides adequate background about what you mean by that.

p. 4

"a common meaning space that allows to share computation"
- just one example of nonstandard grammar in this paper

"Building on this we can build a VRE with classical techniques for integrated development environments"
- Perhaps you could add a reference to a comparison case or two that would back up this claim.

p. 5

"mathematical vernacular"
- This is sometimes used in a specific formal way, you might need to distinguish your usage from that.  (I.e. *which* mathematical vernacular are you referring to.)

"flexiformalize"
- overrun margin

"Before we go into any detail about how this ontology looks"
- I think before going further you should add a few more details about what the process of flexiformalization is, or at least pointing out that there will be an example presented in Section 4

"must at the same time be system-near"
- at the same time as...?

"in many ways, the core MitM ontology is the conceptual essence of the mathematical VRE."
- interesting.

"latter come in two forms"
- maybe say a bit more about the difference between inclusion and structure in this terminology?

p. 6

"views (the squiggly arrows)"
- what's going on with the upwards-pointing arrow in Figure 3, mod? (i.e. why is this one not dotted?)

"used in in the"
- double word

p. 7

The text should say what LEC SEC and GEC, as well as PyF, C++F, and so on are.

"MitM interviews"
- are these the same as the "views" described before?

p. 8

"the concept of transclusion"
- some readers might not be familiar; a pointer to the LMFDB implementation of this protocol would be useful

"The frontend is written in the web framework Flask"
- relevant here?

"STEX flexiformalization of an LMFDB knowl"
- pointer to the original for comparison?

"composable MMT codecs"
- do these satisfy any category-theoretic properties other than being composable?

p. 10

"adaptor pattern"
- which is?

"h.cardinality()"
- margin overflow

"This is where the MitM paradigm comes to the rescue. With it, the task is reduced to building interface theories and interviews into the core MitM ontology,"
- You could usefully include some reference to previous ideas of a hub language for translation, eg. www.mt-archive.info/MTS-2003-Kanayama.pdf

p. 11

possibly use color-coding in the listing to highlight the @semantic() annotations

"Several variants of the annotations are experimented with..."
- This paragraph seems a bit vague, a pointer to more details would be nice


p. 13

"In this paper we have presented the OpenDreamKit project and the “Math-in-the-Middle” approach"

- I'd definitely suggest to shorten the OpenDreamKit description and make that more high-level, and use the resulting space to add details on the technical & formal work already carried out.

p. 14

"Therefore we invite the CICM community to interact with an contribute to the OpenDreamKit project"
- possibly list some specific questions/ideas/dreams?
