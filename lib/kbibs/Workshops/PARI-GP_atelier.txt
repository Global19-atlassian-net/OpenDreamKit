16 different institutions.

It featured 10 morning talks on

  - mathematical topics and implementation projects : modular forms,
    L-functions, polylogs & multizeta values,

  - packages and interfaces (PARI Jupyter notebook, a number field database,
    an elliptic curve library for cryptography, CADO-NFS, GIAC/XCAS,
    parallel programming with GP2C)

Afternoons allowed ample time for hacking sessions, discussions and training.
