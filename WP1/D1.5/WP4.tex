\paragraph{Overview}

The objective of WorkPackage 4 is to provide modern, robust, and flexible user interfaces for
computation, supporting real-time sharing, integration with collaborative problem-solving,
multilingual documents, paper writing and publication, links to databases, etc. This work is focused primarily around the \Jupyter project, in the form of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhancing existing \Jupyter tools (\taskref{UI}{notebook-collab})
    \item Building new tools in the \Jupyter ecosystem (\taskref{UI}{notebook-verification}, \taskref{UI}{notebook-collab}, \taskref{UI}{vis3d})
    \item Improving the use of \ODK components in \Jupyter and \Sage environments (\taskref{UI}{ipython-kernels}, \taskref{UI}{sage-sphinx}, \taskref{UI}{dynamic-inspect}, \taskref{UI}{pari-python})
    \item Demonstrating effectiveness of WorkPackage 4 results in specific scientific applications (\taskref{UI}{cfd-vis}, \taskref{UI}{oommf-py-ipython-attributes}, \taskref{UI}{oommf-nb-ve}, \taskref{UI}{oommf-tutorial-and-documentation})
    \item Work on Active Documents, which have some goals in common with \Jupyter notebooks (\taskref{UI}{structdocs}, \taskref{UI}{mathhub})
\end{itemize}

Progress across WorkPackage 4 has been highly successful thus far.
Several new software packages have been created,
and existing projects in the \Sage and \Jupyter communities have been improved toward sustainability to serve \ODK objectives.

\paragraph{Milestones}

\subparagraph{\longmilestoneref{UI-vre-prototype}}

\emph{“User story: a group of mathematical researchers with access to
  common computational resources, such as a shared lab computer or
  cloud servers, shall be able to deploy a prototype VRE with
  \JupyterHub, integrating \ODK components.
  The Jupyter kernels for mathematical software developed as part of \ODK
  make computational mathematical components accessible in a \Jupyter
  environment, enabling a Jupyter-based deployment of the relevant
  tools for the researchers.
  The process of working on notebooks is greatly improved by review tools
  developed as part of WP4,
  enabling researchers to collaborate to some degree
  in a shared computational environment.”}

\subparagraph{\longmilestoneref{UI-vre}}

\emph{“The prototype VRE shall be extended with improved ease of deployment, new
  functionality such as interactive 3D visualization and real-time
  collaboration, enabling researchers to collaborate productively in a shared
  computational environment. Finally, integrating notebooks and semantic
  knowledge into a publication / knowledge system enable a continuous process
  of leveraging \ODK components from research to publication.”}

\paragraph{Tasks}

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{UI}{ipython-kernels}}
\label{UI@ipython-kernels}
The first task for this workpackage is to enable the use of \Jupyter
as uniform notebook interface for the relevant computational
components. \delivref{UI}{ipython-kernels-basic} has been delivered,
providing basic \Jupyter kernels for \GAP, \Pari, \Sage, and
\Singular. They are being further improved in preparation for
\longdelivref{UI}{ipython-kernels}.

\longdelivref{UI}{ipython-kernel-sage} has been delivered, further
enhancing \Sage's \Jupyter integration and preparing for the
systematic transition from the legacy custom-built \Sage notebook
application to \Jupyter in the coming months. Beside all the benefits
of a uniform and actively developed interface for the user,
outsourcing the maintenance of this key but non disciplinary component
will save the \Sage community much needed resources and is an
important step toward the sustainability of the \ODK ecosystem
(Objective 5).

Progress was particularly fast thanks to a very active involvement of
the \Sage community.

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{UI}{notebook-collab}}

\longdelivref{UI}{jupyter-collab} has been delivered in the form of a new \Jupyter package, nbdime,
enabling easier collaboration on notebooks via version control systems such as Git. This project
was presented at the major Scientific Python conferences SciPy US in July 2016 and EuroSciPy in August 2016,
and has been met with enthusiasm from the scientific Python community for its prospect of solving a
longstanding difficulty in working with notebooks.

The \JupyterHub package has received significant updates and further development, specifically a
\emph{Services extension point}, which enables shared workspaces for collaboration, a step on the path
toward real-time collaboration for \delivref{UI}{jupyter-live-collab}.

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{UI}{notebook-verification}}

\longdelivref{UI}{jupyter-test} has been delivered in the form of a new Python package, nbval,
which enables testing and verification of existing notebooks via a plugin to the Python testing
framework pytest. nbval integrates with nbdime from \delivref{UI}{jupyter-collab} to deliver
testable, reproducible notebooks via traditional software development testing practices.
This work furthers \ODK objective 5 of promoting sustainable software in math and science.

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{UI}{sage-sphinx}}
\label{UI@sage-sphinx}

As part of the Sage Days 77 workshop, we began the long-term work of
\href{https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77/documentation}{refactoring the Sage documentation build
system} for \longdelivref{UI}{sage-sphinx} in collaboration with a Sphinx developer. A great deal
of work has been done toward the goal of sustainability for \Sage's vast documentation, including
improving reproducibility of builds, updating contents, and increasing reliance on
community-standard tools instead of less maintainable bespoke
implementations. Improving the maintainability of the \Sage
documentation build system is an important part of ensuring high quality documentation going forward.

Not applicable for this period.

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{UI}{structdocs}}

Active structured documents are a common need with many use cases, and has many potential solutions.
Requirements and venues for collaborations were explored through discussions between participants,
in particular at the occasion of \href{https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77/}{Sage Days 77} workshop
(see the \href{https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77/live-structured-documents}{notes}), and June's ODK
meeting in Bremen. The findings were reported in \longdelivref{UI}{adstex}.

In \longdelivref{UI}{adcomp}, We have presented a general framework for in-situ computation in active documents. This is
a contribution towards using mathematical documents -- the traditional form mathematicians
interact with mathematical knowledge and computations -- as a user interface for a
mathematical virtual research environments. This is also a step towards integrating the
two main UI frameworks under investigation in the \ODK project: \Jupyter notebooks and
active documents -- see~\delivref{UI}{adstex} -- at a conceptual level. The system is
prototypical at the moment, but can already be embedded into active documents via a
Javascript framework and is ready for use in the \ODK project. The user interface and \SCSCP
connections are quite fresh and need substantial testing and optimizations.


\subparagraph{\longtaskref{UI}{mathhub}}

One of the most prominent features of a virtual research environment (VRE) is a unified user interface. The \ODK approach is to create a mathematical VRE by integrating various pre-existing mathematical software systems. There are two approaches that can serve as a basis for the \ODK UI: computational notebooks and active documents. The former allows for mathematical text around the computation cells of a real-eval-print loop of a mathematical software system and the latter makes semantically annotated documents active.

\MathHub is a portal for active mathematical documents ranging from formal libraries of theorem provers to informal – but rigorous – mathematical documents lightly marked up by preserving LaTeX markup.

As the authoring, maintenance, and curation of theory-structured mathematical ontologies and the transfer of mathematical knowledge via active documents are an important part of the \ODK VRE toolkit, the editing facilities in \MathHub play a great role for the project,
as delivered in \longdelivref{UI}{mathhub-editing}.

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{UI}{vis3d}}

The current landscape for 3D visualization in Jupyter has been explored and reported on,
in order to identify where \ODK can best contribute to 3D visualization in the notebook, towards \longdelivref{UI}{vis3d}. There have been many community-led developments in this area, including the ipyvolume and K3D packages, and \ODK will further enhance existing community tools to best serve the needs of the community. In particular, developing tools for unstructured mesh visualization and CFD simulations. The SciViJS tool for interactive visualization in a webbrowser has been developed, and will gain better support for use in \Jupyter, also as part of \delivref{UI}{vis3d}.

The micromagnetic virtual research environment is hosted in the \Jupyter
Notebook. The computational engine is the (existing) \OOMMF (Object Oriented
MicroMagnetic Framework) which is accessible through the new Python interface
that has been created as part of \ODK  
(\taskref{component-architecture}{oommf-python-interface}). The \Jupyter Notebook allows us to
integrate the problem specification, the execution of the calculation, and the
postprocessing and data representation within a single executable document;
providing a new computational research environment for micromagnetic
simulation that uses the most widely used simulation code. We have enhanced
this environment further by exploiting that the notebook allows objects to
represent themselves in different ways within the notebook. For example,
Python objects that represent mathematical equations in the micromagnetic VRE
appear rendered as \LaTeX{} in the notebook. It allows users to interactively
compose and explore computational models, and to be able to inspect what they
have put together in the language of the scientist (i.e. through equations)
rather than through the language of the computer (i.e. code). The addition of
this representation options does not stop the code from being valid \Python
that can be run outside the notebook. We have also provided a graphical
representation of the mesh and discretisation cell as the appropriate
representation of a finite difference mesh to further assist the effective
communication between code and science user, graphical representation of
vector field objects, and GUI elements for data exploration. We have used dissemination workshops 
to seek feedback from users and to refine interface.

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{UI}{pari-python}}
\label{UI@pari-python}

Completing \longdelivref{UI}{pari-python-lib1} happened to be more difficult than
originally planned. The high level of coupling between \Sage internals
and the \Pari interface made it very delicate to pull the latter out
of the \Sage codebase. Initially planned to be delivered in month 6,
it was only completed in month 16.

The process of making this deliverable possible led to a great amount
of refactoring inside the \Sage project.
The benefits go beyond this deliverable:
implementations of \href{https://github.com/videlec/pplpy}{PPL}
and \href{https://github.com/fplll/fpylll}{fpLLL}
Python interfaces indirectly relied on this work.

As summarized in
\href{http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20238}{Trac ticket 20238},
it required close to 50 \emph{tickets}, which fell in the
following categories:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item Moving \Sage's C interrupts and signals API to a separate \Python/\Cython
  package called
  \href{https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals}{cysignals}.
\item Decoupling \Sage's \Pari interface from the \emph{coercion
    model}.
\item Upgrading the \Pari interface to the latest upstream version
  (2.9.2).
\item Cleaning up the \Pari interface API, by removing unneeded object
  orientation and external dependencies.
\item Moving the \Pari interface to a separate \Python/\Cython package
  \href{https://github.com/defeo/cypari2}{CyPari2}, depending
  on cysignals.
\end{itemize}

The end results of this work are the packages
\href{https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals}{cysignals} and
\href{https://github.com/defeo/cypari2}{CyPari2}, both installable
in a pure \Python environment via the standard tool
\texttt{pip}. Starting from version 8.0, installation via \texttt{pip}
is \Sage's default way of providing the \Pari interface.
