\section{Deviations from Annex 1 (if applicable)}
  % Explain the reasons for deviations from the DoA, the consequences and the proposed
  % corrective actions

There was no major deviation from Annex 1. All deliverables due for M18 were delivered
  within the timeframe of the 1st Reporting Period, and all milestones in this period were
  reached.  Slight modifications were brought to \WPref{hpc} and \WPref{dksbases} and were
  included in the AMD-676541-13.

    \subsection{Tasks}

No deviation from the tasks. All workplan is on time at the end of the Reporting Period.
% Include explanations for tasks not fully implemented, critical objectives not fully
  % achieved and/or not being on schedule.  Explain also the impact on other tasks on the
  % available resources and the planning

  \subsection{Use of resources}
  % Include explanations on deviations of the use of resources between actual and planned
  % use of resources in Annex 1, especially related to person-months per work package.

All changes of use of resources were included in the two amendments previously cited and were
due to modifications in the personnel. Those adjustments were due to the change of positions
of some key \ODK participants and expected difficulties in hiring planned
staff. The work plan has been updated accordingly, with no foreseeable
impact on the achievement of tasks, deliverables, and milestones.

  % characteristics of the project; c) the confirmation that the subcontractor has been
  % selected ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the lowest price and
  % avoiding any conflict of interests

\subsubsection{Unforeseen use of in kind contribution from third party against payment or
  free of charges (if applicable)}

 Not applicable. 
 % Specify in this section: d) the identity of the third party; e) the resources made
  % available by the third party respectively against payment or free of charges f)
  % explanation of the circumstances which caused the need for using these resources for
  % carrying out the work.
