\section{Update of the plan for exploitation and dissemination of result (if
    applicable)}
 Not applicable
 % Include in this section whether the plan for exploitation and dissemination of results
  % as described in the DoA needs to be updated and give details.

\section{Update of the Data Management Plan}

% Include in this section whether the data management plan as described in the DoA needs to be updated and give details.
\ednote{MK: Not really applicable, but describe how the data management plan has been changed} 


\section{Follow-up of recommendations Quality Management}

In this section, we will detail our actions in response to the recommendations and
comments of the reviewers and review the risk management and quality assurance procedures
adopted in in \pn project.

\section{Deviations from Annex 1 (if applicable)}
  % Explain the reasons for deviations from the DoA, the consequences and the proposed
  % corrective actions

There was no major deviation from Annex 1. All deliverables due for M18 were delivered
  within the timeframe of the 1st Reporting Period, and all milestones in this period were
  reached.  Slight modifications were brought to \WPref{hpc} and \WPref{dksbases} and were
  included in the AMD-676541-13.

\subsection{Tasks}
% Include explanations for tasks not fully implemented, critical objectives not fully
% achieved and/or not being on schedule.  Explain also the impact on other tasks on the
% available resources and the planning

No deviation from the tasks. All workplan is on time at the end of the Reporting
Period.

However, there were four\ednote{MK@NT: please check} deliverables that were handed in
late. We will explain the situation and consequences for the project in each case. As a
consequence, Milestone 2 (Implementations), which was due in Month 24 has only been
reached in Month 36.\ednote{MK: what more to say here}

\subsubsection{\protect\delivtref{dissem}{ils-tool}}
\ednote{MK: explain what was the matter.}

\subsubsection{\protect\delivtref{UI}{ipython-kernels}}

This deliverable of full-featured kernels for GAP, Pari, Singular, etc.
has been delivered in month 36 after a delay of 12 months.
The initial plan was for delivery in Month 24,
but was delayed to ensure a high quality of the delivered software,
as more time-sensitive resources were directed away from this task
during months 12-24.
The delay had no impact beyond the deliverable itself,
as no other tasks relied strongly on this deliverable being ready,
and the result is a much stronger collection of Jupyter kernels
for mathematical software.

\subsubsection{\protect\delivtref{UI}{sage-sphinx}}

This deliverable is delivered in month 36,
a delay of 12 months after the initial schedule of month 24.
Progress was slower than planned,
due to the nature of coordinating with large software collaborations.
Additionally, work was shifted to other tasks during early stages,
resulting in the delay of this deliverable.
There have been no negative consequences of the delay,
as its delivery was not a prerequisite for other tasks.
As a result of the delay, we have delivered much greater work
than initially planned, including significant improvements
to the Sphinx documentation system itself used by projects
all over the world,
and an Enhancement Proposal to improve the Python language itself,
ensuring wide impact for this work.


\subsubsection{\protect\delivtref{dksbases}{psfoundation}}
\ednote{@MK explain what was the matter.}

\subsection{Use of resources}
% Include explanations on deviations of the use of resources between actual and planned
% use of resources in Annex 1, especially related to person-months per work package.

All changes of use of resources were included in the two amendments previously cited and were
due to modifications in the personnel. Those adjustments were due to the change of positions
of some key \ODK participants and expected difficulties in hiring planned
staff. The work plan has been updated accordingly, with no foreseeable
impact on the achievement of tasks, deliverables, and milestones.

\subsubsection{Unforeseen subcontracting (if applicable)}

Not applicable.
% Specify in this section: a) the work (the tasks) performed by a subcontractor which
  % may cover only a limited part of the project; b) explanation of the circumstances
  % which caused the need for a subcontract, taking into account the specific
  % characteristics of the project; c) the confirmation that the subcontractor has been
  % selected ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the lowest price and
  % avoiding any conflict of interests

\subsubsection{Unforeseen use of in kind contribution from third party against payment or
  free of charges (if applicable)}

 Not applicable. 
 % Specify in this section: d) the identity of the third party; e) the resources made
  % available by the third party respectively against payment or free of charges f)
  % explanation of the circumstances which caused the need for using these resources for
  % carrying out the work.
