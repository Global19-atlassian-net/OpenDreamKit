\subsubsection{WorkPackage 2:  Community Building, Training, Dissemination, Exploitation, and Outreach}
\label{dissem}
%Explain, task per task, the work carried out in WP during the reporting period giving details of the work carried out by each beneficiary involved.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Overview}

  We have continued the work started in period one, especially on \longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination-communication} and 
  \longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination}, organizing or participating in more than 50 events throughout the last two years.
  In particular, we have intensified our efforts in \textbf{training} the community to use the tools developed through \ODK.
  Indeed we have had 14 workshops or events directly organized by \ODK on subjects such as Jupyter, JOOMF (see \longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-virtual-environment}), PARI/GP, and more. On top of that, we were also part of 5 SageDays.
  
  One of our priorities is to increase the diversity of the open-source community in science. We have been organizing 
  and supporting initiatives to support women developers and scientists such as: Women in Sage, Code First: Girl, and
  PyLadies. We have also organized specific events in developing countries: Colombia, Mexico, and Morocco.

  Finally, this period was also an occasion to improve our online communication, following the advice of our last review.
  Indeed, we collaborated with students in communication to design a new website. We have also conducted interviews to explain
  the key points of the project and we are working on some multimedia content.

\paragraph{Tasks}

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination-communication}}

We have followed the advice from our reviewers and have worked at a better communication:
\begin{itemize}
\item We have worked in collaboration with a master degree in web communication and design. The 
\ODK website was the year project of a team of three students who delivered different reports to us, some
new communication ideas and a whole new website design. We implemented the new design ourselves and 
organized a small workshop to think as a group about the website organization and content. 
\item To reach a wider audience, we decided to use different media for communication. We hired an interviewer
and created short videos to share with our views on project's goals and achievement with our communities. These
video are in final stage of edition and will be released shortly and made available on the website.
\item We have worked with some designer to create infographic content describing some use cases
of our project. The infography gives a clear and fast way to understand the tools we are developing. It
should be soon made available on our website.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{training-portal}}

Training is a core and transversal aspect of our project. It is carried out
through interventions and events as we discuss in \longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination}. These 
past two years especially, there is been a very strong effort from the \ODK team to organize 
training events and workshops. We are also working on creating better content on our webpage
to help users understand in what aspect of their work can \ODK help. This is why we have create the 
``Use Cases'' section.

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{devel-workshops}}
\label{dissem@devel-workshops}

Development workshops are a key aspect of OpenDreamKit development model. The aim of these workshops is to bring together developers from the different communities to design and implement some
of the wanted features. As reported in \longdelivref{dissem}{workshops-3}, we have organized
or co-organized 12 of these workshops throughout years 2 and 3 of the project. The thematics varies
for each event: PARI/GP, Linbox, and many cross-thematic events such as GAP-Sage and GAP-Jupyter days, 
live structured documents, low level libraries, and more.

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{tech-review}}

This task has been started during period one, especially through \delivref{dissem}{techno}. We continue
to keep track of new technologies and report by writing blog posts on our website.


\subparagraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination}}

Dissemination is a key aspect of the success of OpenDreamKit. Indeed, our development is carried
out to help and support mathematical communities. One of the goals is to bring
more users and more developers to the different projects we are involved in. The events
that took place during Years 2 and 3 have been reported in \longdelivref{dissem}{workshops-3}.

\begin{compactitem}
\item \textbf{Training workshops and events.} This has been the most important aspect of this task
for the past two years. We have been organizing 14 events covering subjects such as: Jupyter, JOOMMF,
Bioinformatics, HPC, PARI/GP, GAP, experimental mathematics, web data, reproducible workflows.
\item \textbf{Organization of Sage Days in established mathematical communities.} Sage Days have long been
part of the SageMath tradition. By organizing and supporting Sage Days, OpenDreamKit can stay close
the mathematical community, understand its needs, gather more users and developers, and improve
the overall quality of the software. We have been involved in 5 different such events since the beginning
of the project.
\item \textbf{Training activities in developing countries.} \ODK has been present in Colombia for the second time at
the conference ECCO. We also organized SageDays workshops in Mexico and Algeria as well as a PARI/GP event in Morocco.
\item \textbf{Women in \ODK.} Following the organization of Women in Sage in January 2017, two female \ODK participants
have given time and energy to this specific topic. Viviane Pons organized the Women in Sage event, she has also been 
an organizer of the \textit{Pyladies Paris} chapter for the last two years. Another Women in Sage is planned for summer 2019. Tania
Allard was a research software engineer for \ODK until July 2018, she worked at the \textit{Code First: Girl} chapter in
Sheffield, and was also invited to the \textit{Diversity and Inclusion in Scientific Computing} event in 2018.
\end{compactitem}

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{project-intro}}

Some work has been carried out on this topic by University of Sheffield and University of Leeds which can be seen by 
the many training activities  and wokshops that have been organized on various topics (bioinformatic, HPC, Web data). 
The goal is to introduce the Jupyter notebook to researchers and teachers of various scientific fields. A frame work
has also been built to allow teachers to easily create a course website based on Jupyer.

Besides, the University Paris-Sud has been experimenting teaching C++ programming using Jupyter on a big scale course
of 400 students. They have been working closely with the developers of the C++ kernel and have been trying different
technical solutions which will be documented in a blogpost.

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-virtual-environment}}
\label{dissem@dissemination-of-oommf-nb-virtual-environment}

This task was mostly carried out during the first period. The JOOMF project is working and available on GitHub 
(\href{https://github.com/joommf}{JOOMMF repo}).For each JOOMMF package we use \href{https://travis-ci.org/joommf/discretisedfield}{continuous integration on Travis CI} where we perform tests and monitor the test coverage, which we then make available on \href{https://codecov.io/}{Codecov}. Documentation for each package consists of APIs (automatically generated from the code) and different tutorials created in Jupyter notebooks. Both of them are tested on Travis CI. Documentation is built and made publicly available on \href{http://discretisedfield.readthedocs.io}{Read the Docs}. After every major milestone, we upload each package to the Python Package Index repository. We encourage the early use of our software and invite for feedback for which we provide several different communication channels: Google group (joommf-news), \href{https://gitter.im/joommf/}{Gitter channel}, \href{https://github.com/joommf/help}{GitHub help repository}, \href{https://twitter.com/joommf}{Twitter account}, and a \href{http://joommf.github.io/}{website}.

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-workshops}}
\label{dissem@dissemination-of-oommf-nb-workshops}

We had several workshops and tutorials during major events where we demonstrated the use of our Micromagnetic VRE, received feedback and feature requests from the community:

\begin{compactitem}
\item IOP Magnetism in April 2017, univ. of York.
\item Intermag in April 2017, Dublin.
\item MMM in November 2017, Pittsburgh.
\item Advances in Magnetism in February 2018, Italy.
\end{compactitem}

\subparagraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{ibook}}

Two books, \emph{Linear Algebra and its Applications} (lectures for physicists) and \emph{Nonlinear process in Biology} \delivref{dissem}{ibook2} have been delivered as planned. The source code can be found on our \href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/iODKbook2}{GitHub repo}. We will keep updating and improving the content over time.


\subparagraph{\longtaskref{dissem}{index-librorum-salvificorum}}

The web toolkit \textit{planetaryum} has been delivered \delivref{dissem}{ils-tool}. The joint development efforts under OpenDreamKit, and in particular
the unifying force of the common Jupyter notebook infrastructure, have given a unique occasion
to produce a unified solution applicable to all systems. Following the \ODK philosophy, planetaryum is not a single piece of software, but
rather a toolkit, meant to power many different flavors of curated collections. The source code can be found on our \href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/planetaryum}{GitHub repo}.
