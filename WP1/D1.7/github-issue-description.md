In the first version of the Innovation Management Plan for OpenDreamKit D1.4 (#20), we reviewed some context about the Virtual Research Environment and the end-user / developer relation, described transversal innovations OpenDreamKit is pushing for, provided notes on open source (mathematical) software development  processes, with a focus on some systems the VRE is developing, and presented  elements of strategy for reaching out for a wide range of end-users.

This second version complements this with two sections. In the first one, we review the choice and impact of open licenses in the context of OpenDreamKit, exemplifying potential issues with concrete examples where the project was actually impacted. Indeed, if most of the usual Intellectual Property issues were easily taken care of in this project thanks to the systematic use of open licenses, a few caveats exist nevertheless. In the second section, we review the different types of outcome of the project and discuss their respective sustainability.

This second version also includes minor updates to the earlier sections, notably to reflect the work plan revisions that occurred after Reporting Period 1.
