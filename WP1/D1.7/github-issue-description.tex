In the first version of the Innovation Management Plan for OpenDreamKit
D1.4
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/20}{\#20}),
we reviewed some context about the Virtual Research Environment and the
end-user / developer relation, described transversal innovations
OpenDreamKit is pushing for, provided notes on open source
(mathematical) software development processes, with a focus on some
systems the VRE is developing, and presented elements of strategy for
reaching out for a wide range of end-users.

This second version complements this with two sections. In the first
one, we review the choice and impact of open licenses in the context of
OpenDreamKit, exemplifying potential issues with concrete examples where
the project was actually impacted. Indeed, if most of the usual
Intellectual Property issues were easily taken care of in this project
thanks to the systematic use of open licenses, a few caveats exist
nevertheless. In the second section, we review the different types of
outcome of the project and discuss their respective sustainability.

This second version also includes minor updates to the earlier sections,
notably to reflect the work plan revisions that occurred after Reporting
Period 1.
