\section{Introduction}




\section{Progress on the project}

In this section, we give a general view on the progress of the
project. We start by recalling some bits of context about \ODK's
approach that are important to understand and evaluate the
progress. Then we describe the general state, and enter in more detail
into the achieved and in progress tasks of the work packages.

\subsection{Some context: \ODK's approach}

Recall that, by design, \ODK's approach to deliver a Virtual Research
Environment (VRE) for mathematics is not to build a monolithic
one-size-fits-all VRE, but rather a toolkit from which it is easy to
setup VRE's customized to specific needs by combining together
components (collaborative workspaces, user interfaces, computational
software, databases, ...) on top of available physical resources (from
personal laptop to cloud infrastructure).

Most of the components preexist as an the ecosystem of open source
software, developed by well established communities of developers. For
example, for interactive computing and data analysis, OpenDreamKit
promotes Jupyter, a web-based general purpose flexible notebook
interface\footnote{a notebook is a document that contains live code,
  equations, visualizations and explanatory text} that targets all
areas of science. A number of Virtual Research Environment already
exist, e.g. powered by SageMathCloud or JupyterHub.

Hence most of the work in \ODK is to foster this ecosystem, improving
the components themselves and their composability:
\begin{itemize}
\item Component architecture (WP3):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item ease of deployment: modularity, packaging, portability,
    distribution, for individual components and combinations thereof.
  \item sustainability of the ecosystem: improving the development workflows.
  \end{itemize}
\item User Interfaces (WP4): enable Jupyter as uniform notebook
  interface, and further improve it; foster the collaboration between
  SageMathCloud and JupyterHub; generally speaking investigate
  collaborative, reproducible, and active documents.
\item Performance (WP5): make the most of available hardware
  (multicore, HPC, cloud), for individual computational components and
  combinations thereof.
\item Data/Knowledge/Software (WP6): enable rich and robust
  interaction between computational components, data bases, knowledge
  bases, users through explicit common semantic spaces, a language to
  express them, and tools to leverage them.
\end{itemize}
This worked is backed up by
\begin{itemize}
\item Community building and dissemination (WP2): developer and
  training workshops, conferences, teaching material, ...
\item A study of Social aspects (WP7): analysis of user needs and
  research on collaborative software development in mathematics
\end{itemize}

As a result of \ODK's approach, the work programme for \ODK consists
of a large array of loosely coupled tasks, each being useful in its
own right, and none being absolutely critical.

This first year confirmed that this is a strong feature of \ODK's
approach. Indeed, as analyzed in the proposal, this kind of project is
subject to the following risks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Recruitment of qualified personnel
\item Lack of predictability for tasks that are pursued jointly with
  the community
\end{itemize}
Together with challenging software aspects and rapidly evolving
technologies, this makes the prediction of workload and timeline for
tasks guess work at best, especially over a period of four years. The
loose coupling gives much flexibility, allowing to reshuffle tasks
schedule and human resources allocation, with little influence on the
general plan.

\subsection{General progress}

\TODO{check links below}

Intensive work has now started on almost all fronts of the project. A
few tasks (and the corresponding deliverables) have been postponed by
a couple months due to recruitment delays. This concern mostly the
micromagnetic VRE demonstrator (T2.7, T2.8, T2.9, T3.8, T4.11, T4.13,
T4.14, T7.4)\TODO{use taskrefs}. Some deliverables got delayed as well
by a couple months due to unexpected technical difficulties or
misplanning (e.g. \delivref{hpc}{pythran-typing},
\delivref{hpc}{sage-paral-tree}, \delivref{UI}{pari-python-lib1}). On
the other hand, we are happy to report below on very strong
recruitment (see Section~\ref{...}), as well as unexpectedly rapid
progress on portability and packaging aspects. Also WP6
(Data/Knowledge/Software) has witnessed a particularly strong and
early uptake, with active involvement of many of the participants and
promising outcomes.

All in all, \ODK is running according to its plan, and its first
outcome are already benefiting the mathematical community and beyond.

\TODO{Use some KPI's to support that claim?}

\subsection{Achievements and ongoing progress in workpackages}

\subsubsection{WP1}

Anything to say here?

\subsubsection{WP2: Community building and dissemination}

As planned in \taskref{dissem}{dissemination-communication} and
\taskref{dissem}{dissemination}, XXX meetings, developer and training
workshops have been organized and coorganized by \ODK during year 1,
and many more are being organized, including the first Women in Sage
workshop in Europe and three major training conferences (tentatively
at CIRM, Dagstuhl, and ICMS); \ODK and \ODK related work is regularly
presented at conferences (see the report for
\delivref{UI}{workshops-1}).

...

\subsubsection{WP3: Component architecture}

The first task of this workpackage is to improve the portability of
computational components
\taskref{component-architecture}{portability}. A particular challenge
is the portability of \Sage (and therefore all its dependencies)
on Windows, which has remained elusive for a decade, despite many
efforts of the community. We are happy to report that, in particular
thanks to months of intensive and expert work by our recruit in Paris
Sud Erik Bray, this challenge is about to be tackled, almost one year
before the expected delivery time.

A focused workshop in March (Sage Days 77) also triggered much work
and progress on the packaging side, both by \ODK participants and the
community. There is now good hope to have proper packages for SageMath
(and its dependencies) on the Debian distribution in the coming
months, a feature that has been desperately longed for over a decade.
The workshop was also the occasion to clarify the modularization,
packaging, and distribution needs and challenges\TODO{link to
https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77/packaging}.

\TODO{
- brief notes on other ongoing tasks?
- T3.2: ref to ongoing work in WP6
}
\subsection{WP4: User interfaces}

The first task for this workpackage is to enable the use of Jupyter as
uniform notebook interface for the relevant computational components
\taskref{UI}{ipython-kernels}. This is well under way for most
components. Progress was particularly fast for \Sage thanks to a
very active involvement of the community; this will enable, in the
coming months, a systematic transition from the legacy \Sage
notebook system to \Jupyter; this is a particularly important
achievement: beside all the benefits of a uniform and actively
developed interface for the user, outsourcing the maintenance of the
notebook interface will save the \Sage community much needed
resources.

A new \Jupyter package, nbdime, was created for \taskref{UI}{jupyter-collab},
enabling easier collaboration on notebooks via version control systems such as git.
This project was presented at SciPy US in July and EuroSciPy in August,
and has been met with enthusiasm from the scientific Python community
for its prospect of solving a longstanding difficulty in working with notebooks.

\TODO{Luca: a focus on one or two other tasks and or brief notes on:
- Jupyter / Jupyter hub improvements
- Discussions about structured documents, reproducibility, ...
- Work on Sphinx documentation started in collaboration with Sphinx
  dev and Sage Days 77 (TODO: mv
  https://www.lri.fr/etherpad/p/sage-days77-documentation to the
  sage-days77 wiki, and link from here)
}
\subsection{WP5: HPC}

TODO{Clément:
- Active development of Pythran
- mention upcoming workshops?
- mention Grenoble's active involvement starting now}

\subsection{WP6: }

\TODO{Michael: you must of some 2-3 paragraphs about what we have
been doing so far, right?}

\subsection{WP7: }

\TODO{Dima: describe briefly the current plan (upcoming workshops)
and evolutions in Oxford with the arrival of many people working on
related areas}

\section{Risk management}
\subsection{Recruitment of highly qualified staff}
 ~\\~\\Recruitment of highly qualified staff was planned to be a high risk when the Poposal was written. And unfortunatly it turned out we were right. In such a field as computer science and software development, potential candidates who are likely to be fairly young considering only temporary positions are offered, are very scarce. Furthermore they need to make a choice between public and provate bodies which are very attractive, and the choice between pure development and research.
Because of this difficulty to recruit in the past year, there have been slight changes in the workplan. Changes which have, of course, not put the project results at risk.

The following people were hired in the past year:\\


\begin{tabular}{|l|c|r|r|r|r|}

\hline
\end{tabular}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item{UPSud:} there were some delay in the recruitment of a project manager (24PM) due to the fact the parti-tim position was less attractive for experienced persons. The recruitment of Erik Bray (36PM) as software developer took also longer than planned because his moving from the USA to France did not go as smoothly as planned. However his skills and results have proven more than once he is the right person at the right place.
The second developer position (36PM) was more problematic for intern administrative reasons to UPSud. Jeroen Demeyer was selected  for the position among other candidates because he had the perfect profile for the job asked from him. However and despise he has the Belgian nationality, since he wished to commute from Belgium to Paris, the UPSud administration refused to offer him a contract longer than 4 months and preferred including a new partner in the OpenDreamKit consortium  and to move the person-months planned for Joeroen Demeyer and all the related budget to that new partner. The OpenDreamKit Steering Committee willing to keep Mr Demeyer on within the project, an amendment to the Grant Agreement was signed between the Coordinator, the Commission, and the University of Gent by whom Jeroen Demeyer is now employed. ++++ SAY SOMETHING ABOUT PHD (36PM) TURNED TO POSTDOC++++\\

\item{CNRS:}The research engineer position (48PM) at the CNRS is not yet filled. The partner has unfortunately failed to recruit someone on time. The position is still open. However this should not postpone any deliverable.\\

\item{JacobsUni:} Michael Kohlase, the PI of the Jacobs Univeristy site, will be change position on the 01/09/2016 to move to the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg. Since most of his team follows him and since he is an important asset to the success of OpenDreamKit, there will be a new amendment to the Grant Agreement in the Autumn 2016. More explanation concerning the terms of the amendment will be given then.\\

\item{UJF:}The UJF had planned to recruit an engineer(12PM) named Pierrick Brunnet who was supposed to begin his work on the 1st of September 2015 for the UJF and OpenDreamKit. However Mr Brunnet decided to decline the offer in order to accept a permanent position. The engineer position will be filled in Autumn 2016 but the deliverable D5.2 had to be delayed from month 12 to month 18. This delay did not have any imapct on other tasks.\\

\item{UNIKL:} UNIKL had to split the 12 PM planned for a software developer into 2 shorter positions (Anders Jensen and Alexander Kruppa) in order to deliver the planned work on time. Indeed the few qualified persons for this job were not able to accept this 12 months position during the timelapse planned within the project.\\

\item{USFD:} The University of Sheffield has also been struggling in the the hiring process of a postdoc (36PM). The position should be filled this Autumn.\\

\item{Southampton:} Southampton faced administrative difficulties in the recruitment of Marijan Beg (38PM) as a post-doc, due to the Croatian nationality of Mr Beg. His recruitment was delayed of four months, and therefore some tasks and deliverables, planned to be bone around the end of the project, were postponed of a four months. However no serious delay nor implication on the main tasks of OpenDreamKit followed these difficulties.\\
\item{UZH:} The University of Zürich partner is only composed of one person, Paul-Olivier Dehaye, who does not enjoy a permanent position there. There has been worries that Mr Dehaye's contract ends at the University earlier than planned within OpenDreamKit. But thanks to the action of the OpenDreamKit steering committee, Mr Dehaye's position should be renewed for as long as the project needs.\\
\item{Simula:} Everything is fine concerning temporary staff recruitment on the Simula side, however we have had to endure the hazards of Human ressources with Hans-Peter Langtanger (the PI when the Grant was signed) being on a long-term sick leave, and with Martin Alnaes replacing him as PI currently on a paternity leave. However Benjamin Ragan-Kelley has been perfect  substitute leader of the Simula partner and all planned tasks are on time.\\
\end{itemize}

In spite of Human Resources issues, and even though some small workplan reshufflings were made, all tasks and deliverables will be accomplished within the reporting period they were planned.

\subsection{Different groups not forming effective team}
NT
\subsection{Implementing infrastructure that does not match the needs of end-users}

The consortium is keeping in their minds the end-user needs. Since OpenDreamKit is improving already existant softwares which have their own users, their needs are naturally met. However Key performance Indicators will evaluate the effects of OpenDreamKit on these softwares. KPIs, indicated in the Proposal, will be launched this Autumn with the help of the end-user group which was merged with the Advisory Board. Constant links between the accomplished work and the end-user needs should be made in WP2 deliverables and also in WP7 deliverables when relevant.
Open tracking of KPIs evolution can be found on [Github](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/labels/KPI).

\section{Quality assurance plan}

\subsection{Deliverables quality: Quality Review Board}
 ~\\~\\
The Quality Review Board is the Consortium Body that must ensure the quality of deliverables.
The body is chaired by Hans Fangohr, from the University of Southampton. He is helped in this task by Ursula Martin, from the University of Oxford, and from Konrad Hinsen from the Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire. This board must meet after each reporting period, the first one for OpenDreamKit ending at month 18 (February 2017). 
For the moment, deliverables have mostly been discussed in the frame of the Interim Check Review which took place in Bremen on the 28th of June 2016.


The content form of deliverables due by then had to meet the expectations of the Project Officer and of Reviewers. Following this experience, we have concluded that deliverables should be written in Latex using a style file created for this purpose. For deliverables that are not reports by themselves, it's appropriate to have a relatively short report with a link to the github issue, and a copy of the description of this issue. In all cases, the report shall be self-contained. Deliverables are indeed evaluated based upon their versions submitted on the EU portal without retrieving other resources. Links have no legal value, since there is no guarantee that the referenced material will remain unchanged.
Partners who have a deliverable due at month 12 (August 2016) have been following these tips. The feedback of the Official review will help the Quality review Board in ensuring the quality of reports meets the needs. This will be up to the Quality Review Board to meet after the 1st reporting period and to decide if the quality of deliverables is acceptable.
They will aim at identifying good practice and weaknesses, and to share the lessons with the project to improve any future project work. The board will focus on selected deliverables and investigate those in detail rather than attempting a superficial inspection of all deliverables.
