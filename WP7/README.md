# WP7: Social Aspects

Lead Institution: University of Oxford

- Objectives:

The processes by which mathematical knowledge and mathematical software are developed, validated and applied
are quite distinctive. In other sciences, the universe provides “ground truth” and the scientific texts or theories can
be validated against that by experiment. In mathematics the text itself is the ground truth. The traditional model of
mathematical research is a mathematician, or a small group of mathematicians, standing around a blackboard, producing
a proof they would “clean up”: remove all traces of the process that led to its discovery and then submit the “clean” text
to their peers for review.
Mathematicians have adopted new technology in a variety of ways: email and shared documents are used to collaborate
on problem-solving and writing; larger “crowdsourcing” [33, 38], arrangements pull together diverse experts;
symbolic computation tackles huge routine calculations; and computers check proofs that are too long and complicated
for a human to comprehend. These technologies reveal (since email messages, version control systems and bulletin
boards can be analysed) and alter the ways in which mathematicians collaborate.
In an EPSRC funded project “The Social Machine of Mathematics” Martin and others are bringing together rigorous
methods from the social sciences to study these collaborative processes. Combining this research with the algorithmic
game theory expertise of Elkind and Pasechnik, in this work package we intend to pursue the following objectives:
• incorporate the insights from this and similar projects into the design of OpenDreamKit VRE, ensuring that it
supports the ways in which mathematicians really work, rather than the way software developers—or indeed
mathematicians—think they do;
• extend this work to study the collaborative processes of free open source (mathematical) software development
so as to produce guidelines for best practice as well as to develop ideas for extending existing processes to a
“system of systems”.

- Description:

“Crowdsourcing”—fine-grained collaborative development of ideas, proofs or software—is a common theme to both
objectives. The purpose of a VRE is to allow effective crowdsourcing of computationally supported mathematical results
(theorems, proofs, etc.), while free software development is inherently a collaborative process, and we wish to study the
best ways of allowing it to scale.
In a sense, mathematics has been a crowdsourced endeavour, dating as far back as the foundation of the Royal
Society (UK) in the seventeenth century. The first scientific journals were published collections of letters received,
posing questions and observations and offering solutions. Although limited by the speed of physical post, this model had
much in common with the public email lists that underpinned collaborative software development in the 1990s.
In recent years, the internet and critical tools such as distributed version control have supported much more widespread
and finer-grained forms of crowdsourcing, first in software development, and, more recently, in mathematics: examples
are provided by online mathematics communities, such as Math-overflow [24] and Polymath Projects [33, 38]. Supporting
and encouraging “Mutual crowdsourcing” is the main driving force for developing and maintaining any large-scale
open-source virtual research environment.
In this work package we will build on the work of Prof. Martin and her collaborators on the EPSRC project, and,
in particular, their study of crowdsourcing, and integrate their findings with tools provided by the burgeoning field of
algorithmic mechanism design in order to to optimise crowdsourcing workflows in open-source VREs.
