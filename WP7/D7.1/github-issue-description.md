# Deliverable description, as taken from Github issue #148 on 2017-02-27 {.notoc}\n
- **WP7:** [Social Aspects](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/tree/master/WP7)
- **Lead Institution:** University of Oxford
- **Due:** 2017-02-28 (month 18)
- **Nature:** Report
- **Proposal:** [p. 58](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/raw/master/Proposal/proposal-www.pdf) 

In this deliverable we survey the data needed to assess development models of large-scale
academic open-source projects, such as the probable correlation between the
size of the atomic contribution vs. the speed of the contribution making it
into the code, and collect appropriate statistical data, to be published as a
report (and possibly a conference publication). The latter might require
non-trivial amount of programming work, even only for the test system, Sage.

Accomplishments:

- [x] a large number of publications and online sources was reviewed for applicability
- [x] various analytic tools were tried on a sampling of Sage components
- [x] results were summarised in a report, with conclusions and pointers to further possible developments
