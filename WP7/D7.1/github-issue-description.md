OpenDreamKit builds on top of a large ecosystem of (mostly) academic open-source systems, many of which are large-scale themselves: for example our chosen test system [SageMath](http://sagemath.org) is the outcome of a decade of work by hundred of contributors; many others are decades old. The social engineering aspects involved in such a large ecosystems are therefore both intricate and central for its long run sustainability. This motivates OpenDreamKit's objective in WP7 of studying the collaborative processes of free open source (mathematical) software development so as to produce guidelines for best practice as well as to develop ideas for extending existing processes to an “ecosystem of systems”.

In this deliverable we survey the methodology, data, and tools needed to assess development models of large-scale academic open-source systems, such as the probable correlation between the size of the atomic contribution vs. the speed of the contribution making it into the code, and collect appropriate statistical data, to be published as a report (and possibly a conference publication). While in the proposal it was assumed that the latter might require non-trivial amount of programming work, even only for our test system, great open-source tools to address precisely these kinds of questions were released last year, and we used one of them instead. 

Accomplishments:

- [x] a large number of publications and online sources was reviewed for applicability
- [x] various analytic tools were tried on a sample of SageMath components
- [x] results were summarised in a report, with conclusions and pointers to further possible developments
