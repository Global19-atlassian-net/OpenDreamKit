We will survey the data needed to assess development models of large-scale
academic open-source projects, such as the probable correlation between the
size of the atomic contribution vs. the speed of the contribution making it
into the code, and collect appropriate statistical data, to be published as a
report (and possibly a conference publication). The latter will require
non-trivial amount of programming work, even only for the test system, SAGE.
