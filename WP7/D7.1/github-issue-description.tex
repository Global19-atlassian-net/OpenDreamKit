In this deliverable we survey the data needed to assess development
models of large-scale\\
academic open-source projects, such as the probable correlation between
the\\
size of the atomic contribution vs.~the speed of the contribution making
it\\
into the code, and collect appropriate statistical data, to be published
as a\\
report (and possibly a conference publication). The latter might
require\\
non-trivial amount of programming work, even only for the test system,
Sage.

Accomplishments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\checkmark\) a large number of publications and online sources was
  reviewed for applicability
\item
  \(\checkmark\) various analytic tools were tried on a sampling of Sage
  components
\item
  \(\checkmark\) results were summarised in a report, with conclusions
  and pointers to further possible developments
\end{itemize}
